B0DD3VT6D2,W. Horton,U,2,"The product arrived promptly and was easy to set up. It is easy to operate and seems to work very well. The reason for my less than positive review is that the treadmill is simply not wide enough. I find it hard to walk for very long on it because my natural stride has my feet slightly farther apart and I cannot do that on this item since it is not wider. Disappointingly, I would not have purchased if I had realized it was not wider. Otherwise, it appears to be a very good product.",N/A,N/A,positive,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A, 
B0DD3VT6D2,Lily Jones,F,4,"I love the treadmill and no assembly required. There are two things I am not fond of: one is that it is shorter than I am used to, so I have to be careful not to walk off the back of the treadmill. I bought a wheel-free walker just to have something to hold onto while on the treadmill to stay standing straight and avoid moving too much, which was a solution for me. The other thing I don't like is that the speed only goes up to 2.5, which I should have checked before purchasing, but the speed I normally use is 2.6 or 2.7 for walking, so it's not a big issue. Overall, the treadmill works very smoothly, is very sturdy and well built, and I am still glad I purchased it even with the two cons.",positive,N/A,N/A,positive,positive,N/A,positive,N/A,N/A,N/A,

B0DD3VT6D2,Hannah,F,1,"DO NOT BUY. Where do I even begin? Within 5 minutes on this “walking” pad, it started throwing me off like a mechanical bull at a county fair. It went from “gentle stroll in the park” to “tell my family I love them” in record time. Apparently, the belt has a mind of its own—sliding left, right, then left again—like it’s auditioning for a terrible Broadway dance number.Adjusting the belt? Sure! Just grab an Allen wrench, twist some knobs, whisper a prayer, and you might as well do the Hokey Pokey because that’s about as successful as you’ll get at straightening this contraption out. I spent more time fiddling with it than actually walking, and by the end, my heart rate was up only from frustration, not exercise. In the end, if you’d like to add some excitement to your home—perhaps by yelling at an inanimate object every morning—go for it.

At 65+ this is for winter and harsh weather time to keep the ole joints ""greased"". If you have a long gait or a widespread walking habit you may run into the issue of being too short and narrow. This isn't a design defect just simply made for people with different needs.

I was able to take it apart easily and fill in/cover the speaker (circled in red) with Hot Glue. I chose hot glue since it was already present in other places. It is now the perfect walking pad. It runs very quietly and the beeping sound is now minimal. I most likely voided my warranty doing this but I am happy.

B0DD3VT6D2,Rachel,F,3,"Pros: works right out of the box. I've walked on it for 3 sessions of 30-45 minutes between 2 and 3.5 mph with almost no issues (230lb 5'10""). It had no problem keeping up the pace, and generally the belt did not slip (see below for the exception). It is easy to move, and it connects with the app easily. The remote works.Walking experience: The walking surface is less shock-absorbent than a ""real"" treadmill, but still passable. Know that even the larger ""plus"" model is much smaller than your average treadmill. If you are tall like me, it takes some practice to be able to walk without scraping the front of the cover while also not letting your feet off the end. For me, it's exactly big enough to walk normally with zero extra space. I would have liked an extra inch or two on the sides and in the length so that I didn't have to train myself to stay in the exact ideal spot.On belt slipping: The belt assembly comes mostly balanced -- I noticed some minor drift at first, but nothing major. But I have a, perhaps unwise, habit of stepping off of treadmills at low speed or during their cooldown phase by letting the belt pull me off the end and landing on one foot. I did it on this one, and the belt became horribly unbalanced, slid all the way to one side, and ground a small divot into the plastic of the side rail before I could get it to stop. It took about 20 minutes of careful adjustment with the included allen key to get it to run normally again. This is likely user error, but be aware that the belt assembly is more delicate than your average, more durable treadmill, as I've never had this issue on ""real"" treadmills. I would recommend always using its ramp-up and ramp-down functions instead of jumping on or off at speed to avoid this. There are good tutorials online for tightening and balancing a treadmill belt.Safety concern: The manual mentions a magnetic safety key, but my model does not seem to have one, and runs normally without any kind of key. As I don't plan on going higher than 3.5mph, and as it is very close to the ground, this does not concern me a ton, but it is something to consider. There do not appear to be any other safety features, other than the physical guards and warning labels.App: I haven't used it aside from testing the direct treadmill control functions. It did connect easily to the treadmill via bluetooth/wifi, and the controls from your phone do seem to work, which is great to have in case I lose the remote. The little virtual running game does seem functional, though I'm not particularly interested in the social media or monetization aspect of it.",positive,N/A,N/A,positive,positive,positive,positive,N/A,N/A,N/A,

B0DD3VT6D2,Honest Review,U,5,I received this item about a week before the scheduled delivery so that was a pleasant surprise. I tested it out last night and used it again this morning after my workout at the gym and I have to say I’m super happy with this purchase. It arrived just in time as the weather has changed and it’s too cold to do my normal walk through the neighborhood in the morning.

B0DD3VT6D2,Myra Hicks,F,5,"It’s perfect to have in the corner of the office. When turned on it beeps loud and the motor is just a soft hum, not loud at all. When you walk on it is when it’s a bit louder (just from the belt rubbing against the tread as you step) and could bother other people around if you work in a space with others. I keep mine in an empty space currently with the door closed and no one can hear me walking on it only the beeps when you turn it off. Easy to use too. You only need to plug it in, flip the on/off switch in the front. It comes with a remote that I think it’s really neat and an extra battery. It also comes with a bolt tightening tool and lubricant for the belt. It’s built sturdy and has wheels. I really like it and it’s not too big, it’s a decent size if you don’t have a wide walk.

B0DD3VT6D2,Natasha Noire,F,4,"Latest update: It’s back to working. Not sure why the tool wasn’t working for me before but it is now. I haven’t had to adjust the belt quite as often. Maybe I’ve lost a few pounds (not from the device) so it stopped sliding as much without the pressure.Edited again: Back to the belt sliding and this time, the tool to adjust it isn’t working. It doesn’t turn enough to adjust it. I’ll keep you updated.Edited review: I used this walking pad 4 times before the belt slipped. They send a tool to align it. It took some work around to get it right but the Universe delivered because now it’s where I need it to be. It’s still not as stable as I would like but it works well enough to get the job done. Good value for the money I spent.I do wish the remote control had a pause button but maybe I missed that somewhere. Because I have to stop it every time, it starts the count over, but maybe the app fixes that. I didn’t download it. I like that the remote has a handle to keep around the wrist. Easy to use.

It’s perfect for casual walking while working or watching TV.L E N G T HAt 5’2”, the length of the walking pad is just right for me, but my 6’2” friend said it feels a bit short for his stride. So, if you’re taller, this could be something to consider.Q U A L I T YThe walking pad feels sturdy overall, and I appreciate that it was ready to use right out of the box—no assembly required. However, sometimes it glitches if I press the start button too quickly, and I have to restart it.A C C E S S I B I L I T YMoving it around is a bit of a hassle. While it’s not overly difficult, I frequently switch between walking and sitting while working, and I wish there was an easier way to move it. Also, I don’t have a convenient place to hide it, so it stays out in the open when not in use.S A F E T YThere’s no emergency stop feature, and the sides of the pad are small, so if I need to take a quick break, I either have to jump off or turn it off completely, which can be inconvenient.S T A T SEDIT: to Pause this machine you have to HOLD the pause button and it keeps your stats![Another annoying thing is that the stats reset when you hit pause, so your time and distance disappear. It would be nice to pause it for a quick break and pick up where I left off. But it’s not a dealbreaker.]S O U N DIt’s loud when you turn it on, and the beeping every time you increase or decrease the speed is pretty annoying. I hate the startup sound, but it’s not horrible—just one of those things you put up with.T A K E A W A YBecause of the price, I tolerate the negatives. I honestly love how easy it is to get my steps in, especially living in Arizona, where it’s too hot to walk outside most of the year.Would I buy it again? Maybe. Probably not this exact model, as I would prefer one with an incline, but that’s on me for not noticing that part.

Since starting a sedentary job and starting to have kids, I’ve gained a lot of weight and I just don’t have the energy to do anything. I work from home 3 days a week and bought a standing desk to help reduce my sedentary job, but it didn’t seem to do much. I got this walking pad and have been using it for a few months and while I haven’t lost much weight, I feel better and I can tell it’s made a difference. I’m able to walk about 5 miles during the day while I’m working. This is a huge increase from the zero I was doing before.On to the specific pad. This pad seems to be quieter than the few I’ve seen. I’m about 225 pounds and a couple others I tried out were pretty loud every time you stepped on it. The plastic pieces would creak and kind of grind and this one doesn’t do that. The motor itself is fairly quiet, but on par with others I tried. Its not quiet enough to do while on the phone h less you had a really effective noise canceling headset.The instructions are pretty clear and it comes with a bottle of oil to lubricate it. It also tells you how to adjust the pad if it slides off at all. My floor is actually slightly slanted (120 yr old house) and the belt does get slightly off because of this. It’s super easy to fix.I’ve seen some of these where they fold or roll out of the way easily and this doesn’t do that, but I never expected it to.It has both count down and count up features, which is. Ice. The remote it comes with works perfectly and I haven’t had any problems with it. The pad only goes to 3.8 which I’m guessing was determined to be the fastest speed while still being safe.

It's an extremely complex project that requires me to be on my computer all day every day for long hours, 7 days a week. Needless to say, I've put on more pounds that I would have liked... it just doesn't help that the only walking I was doing was to walk to the refrigerator and back to my desk. I got a sit to stand desk so at least I could get out of the chair and stand for a while, and that did help a lot, but I still just found it nearly impossible to take the time out to go for a real walk... so I got this, specifically so I could walk while working on my project. I find that under my desk in standing position, it works pretty well, I would not recommend it just in the middle of a room without a desk, because you have nothing to hold onto for balance... this is really only meant to be under a standing desk because it has no handrails. It is easy to put in place and to roll away to a corner when I need to sit for a while. I use it as much as I can, but to be honest, it's difficult to work on certain aspects of my project while walking, it's not the device, it's just a matter of being able to operate my computer while walking... I cannot type hardly at all while walking, and for my CAD designs and solid models, they require precision mouse usage, and even though I have a professional trackball that is very precise, if I am walking, it's hard to make it track correctly. There are some tasks I can do while walking, like checking emails, searching for and purchasing supplies and materials on Amazon, or generating invoices for customers... stuff that doesn't take any extensive typing or precision mouse movements... so I do get some use out of it... and it actually keeps me on task a little better because if I set up this treadmill, then I want to get all those things done while it's set up, because I know once I go back to the more critical tasks, I won't be able to use it... so it prevents me from flip-flopping between tasks as I need to set it up and put it away.",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,positive,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"wheels, desk compatibility"

B0DPLTD9VL,zach sodano,U,1,the size of this walking pad is a little small for me. i have a size 11 foot so its kinda big and after a few steps i almost fall off the thing. the remote seems a little cheap. it was very easy to set up but im looking for one that is a little bit more heavy duty. the belt seems ok but it moves alot when you are walking. overall its ok but i would say look for a more durable bigger one,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,positive,positive,positive,N/A,N/A,N/A,remote

I started checking them out on Amazon. I decided on this one because it had features I liked such as time, distance, calories and speed and they were all remotely controlled.Set up was a breeze Out of the box and ready to use.

B0DPLTD9VL,Lamont,U,4,"I got this because here it gets amazingly hot outside during the Summer and there is no way I will be exercising in that heat. I find that it it too long to fit under my desk, so it is off to the side against a wall. I find it easy to use with the remote, though that did take some getting used to. It works fine, mine is a little noisy, but that's to be expected.The only real negative that people should look out for is the fact that it is a walking pad, so it doesn't have a console upfront for you to lean on, or grab if you lose your balance. I would definitely think twice about getting this if you have balance issues or anything of that nature.

B0DPLTD9VL,highlandmck,U,1,"BEWARE the belt is only 15 inches wide!!! The photo they show is completely deceptive - it looks huge - the woman in the photo must have been photoshopped in. The ad claims it's 19 inches wide but they're counting the width of the entire unit! I was doing sort of ok in bare feet or socks only, able to stay on -- but when I put sneakers on I was immediately thrown to the side twice in a row when my shoe went slightly off the belt. Thrown aside again on a third try before giving up. I was even using trekking poles for balance. It's a dangerous fall risk especially for an older person or weaker person who cannot risk a fall!

It powers on but the belt will not move. Attempted yet again to pair the remote, which you should never have to do more than once. Shocker, it did not work. Swapped the batteries multiple times. Still nothing. Nothing works on the remote. Buy something that is NOT run by a remote. Cheap piece of crap. If I could give it zero stars I would. I relied on other reviews before making my purchase too. I asked for a replacement. They said it would take 2.5 weeks to arrive. Crazy, considering my original purchase arrived in two days.
