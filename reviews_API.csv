Whoever engineered the packaging for this treadmill did not do a good job. I was so irritated. It was so hard to get out the box. They were unreasonable tapes, and other items that just made it hard. That alone is why I’m giving it a three star. I haven’t even tried it yet, but I’m so aggravated by the process of unpacking that I just wanna be done. if I had known, it would’ve been so difficult I would not have ordered it. I would definitely say if you get a box with a treadmill like I did you will need more than one person and you will need razors and other devices in hopes that you don’t cut the treadmill on the process. Poorly constructed box and packaging. Not very good at all. You are lucky I’m not giving you one star.I’m actually updating my review after trying to set it up. Be warned you cannot just use it without downloading an app and signing up. This is ridiculous. You should not have to download an app and put more of your data out there for you to use this treadmill. It’s just another opportunity for people to collect data from you.

It does have a powerful motor and it is quiet while it’s running. The only reasons why I’m giving it 4 stars are:1. Using the remote to pause/start and or adjust speed makes really loud beeping sounds so if you want to do this while on a work call everyone will hear the beeps for sure! It has an app which I haven’t downloaded so not sure if you can control these things on the app in a silent mode.2. Moving it forward and back is easy but the wheels don’t move in a 360 degree motion so if you’re moving it sideways to get it out of the way it can be a bit challenging. I bought this to use under my standing desk while on work calls etc but I have to move it at some point to use my chair so moving it laterally isn’t as comfortable.

R1ZI6EM3VBSXFS,GET IT!! It’s the best purchase EVER!!,JennyBee,5,"I cannot describe my “fitness journey” in any other words than- total failure. I have tried it all for over 30 years and I’ve also given it all up. I’ve purchased all the equipment that became dust collectors or a fancy clothing rack. I did all the videos starting with Tae-Bo waayyyy back in the day, to most recently YouTube workouts. I’ve joined gyms and quit gyms. You get the picture, I have done it all. Suddenly I found myself at 50 yrs old, in menopause hell, and heavier than ever. Diets (my old standby) aren’t helping and I couldn’t afford full body liposuction. So I decided to do what I always hear fitness experts say to do. Start simple and walk 10,000 steps a day. I was about to give up on that because every time I attempted 10,000 steps it seemed impossible! Who has that kind of time? And who goes outside when they can’t? There are days when I can’t go outside and walk around town. There are days when I feel like I can’t even get dressed. Whether it be exhaustion, anxiety, cold weather, or all of the above, there are days when I can’t go outside and walk. I was ready to give up again until I saw an Instagram post. The gorgeous 20-something girl was walking on a walking pad and said “This is the only way I can get my 10,000 steps in and I do it because 10,000 steps works!” Hmmmm…. I became curious. I saw her talk on the phone, answer emails and even eat on her walking pad! I was like “This is how you do it!” and I ordered one immediately. Of course, my doubting inner voice, the one who knows all of my attempts and failures, wasted money and embarrassment said “Don’t do this again you’ll regret it!” Thankfully I didn’t listen! I got the walking pad and I haven’t looked back!! It is the best purchase I’ve ever made! Solved all of my problems and addressed all of my weird issues! If I don’t wanna go outside, I walk on my walking pad in the living room of my own home. If I don’t want to get dressed, I walk on my walking pad in my pajamas. If I don’t want to walk because Im tired, I walk on my walking pad slowly. If I haven’t gotten to 10,000 steps, but my husband wants to get back to the show that we are watching together, I can finish them off while we’re watching our show! It has made getting my steps in possible! It’s very quiet, has wheels on the bottom so I can roll it into different rooms, and is soooooo convenient!

RVN01KC8821UY,WOW! Start out slow and work up the speed and HANG ON to something. HOLD THE REMOTE 100% of the time,Sunshine,5,"Ive had this for a couple months and its really great! You must have something beside you to rest your arm on to stabilize your brain. Then its really easy to use and safe. HOWEVER dont let anyone with any kind of balance issue on this thing over 2.0 setting. NEVER look behind you while your walking either, you can fall easy. This really is great. The display is large and the remote has a magnet so I stick it to a metal chair beside me but I ALWAYS HOLD ONTO THE REMOTE WHILE WALKING!!!!!!!!!!!! Dont put down the remote until your done. I only use this 3-5 mins a day as once you get it over 3.0 its plenty to get your heart pumping. Its amazing for days you sit at a computer all day or if you have extra energy to burn off. If youve been stuck in a chair this is a GOD send. I put 2 small totes beside me to support my arm, I find this helps balance your brain so you feel stable. Do this for everyone no matter what. I find that you must start slow and every 30 seconds you can ease up the speed until you feel its fast enough. I rarely ever go all the way to 4.0. That is a light running speed. Its not a fast running board but after a minute at 4.0 your feeling like your getting lots of exercise. GREAT INVESTMENT = Just be careful and always aware. I find that staring at the display is very helpful. It only takes 3-5 minutes to get a good workout on this thing. Its really quite and I dont like having the lifter legs at the front up. Its much better flat on the floor. I thought it would be good to raise but NO, much better on your legs when its flat and does a GREAT JOB at getting you up and moving.","Reviewed in the United States April 2, 2025",AHH7XJ7LW2N7PK7Z62MYKAL4VBWQ,True,From the United States,Color: Black Orange,B0DMT1FZ3N,

I have tried it all for over 30 years and I’ve also given it all up. I’ve purchased all the equipment that became dust collectors or a fancy clothing rack. I did all the videos starting with Tae-Bo waayyyy back in the day, to most recently YouTube workouts. I’ve joined gyms and quit gyms. You get the picture, I have done it all. Suddenly I found myself at 50 yrs old, in menopause hell, and heavier than ever. Diets (my old standby) aren’t helping and I couldn’t afford full body liposuction. So I decided to do what I always hear fitness experts say to do. Start simple and walk 10,000 steps a day. I was about to give up on that because every time I attempted 10,000 steps it seemed impossible! Who has that kind of time? And who goes outside when they can’t? There are days when I can’t go outside and walk around town. There are days when I feel like I can’t even get dressed. Whether it be exhaustion, anxiety, cold weather, or all of the above, there are days when I can’t go outside and walk. I was ready to give up again until I saw an Instagram post. The gorgeous 20-something girl was walking on a walking pad and said “This is the only way I can get my 10,000 steps in and I do it because 10,000 steps works!” Hmmmm…. I became curious. I saw her talk on the phone, answer emails and even eat on her walking pad! I was like “This is how you do it!” and I ordered one immediately.

The user manual comes with a contact email, and instructions on how to register for the warranty, which I felt good about.

I was looking for a treadmill that included an incline, speed greater than 3.0 mph, and a larger surface pad. This checked my boxes AND at a great price! I am able to walk and work at the same time and before I know it, I’ve walked for over an hour without realizing. I’m able to get in a slow jog if I choose. The unit works by remote control making it a breeze to control at your fingertips. There are wheels on the unit that make for easy movement.

RVN01KC8821UY,WOW! Start out slow and work up the speed and HANG ON to something. HOLD THE REMOTE 100% of the time,Sunshine,5,"Ive had this for a couple months and its really great! You must have something beside you to rest your arm on to stabilize your brain. Then its really easy to use and safe. HOWEVER dont let anyone with any kind of balance issue on this thing over 2.0 setting. NEVER look behind you while your walking either, you can fall easy. This really is great. The display is large and the remote has a magnet so I stick it to a metal chair beside me but I ALWAYS HOLD ONTO THE REMOTE WHILE WALKING!!!!!!!!!!!! Dont put down the remote until your done. I only use this 3-5 mins a day as once you get it over 3.0 its plenty to get your heart pumping. Its amazing for days you sit at a computer all day or if you have extra energy to burn off. If youve been stuck in a chair this is a GOD send. I put 2 small totes beside me to support my arm, I find this helps balance your brain so you feel stable. Do this for everyone no matter what. I find that you must start slow and every 30 seconds you can ease up the speed until you feel its fast enough. I rarely ever go all the way to 4.0. That is a light running speed. Its not a fast running board but after a minute at 4.0 your feeling like your getting lots of exercise. GREAT INVESTMENT = Just be careful and always aware. I find that staring at the display is very helpful. It only takes 3-5 minutes to get a good workout on this thing. Its really quite and I dont like having the lifter legs at the front up. Its much better flat on the floor. I thought it would be good to raise but NO, much better on your legs when its flat and does a GREAT JOB at getting you up and moving.","Reviewed in the United States April 2, 2025",AHH7XJ7LW2N7PK7Z62MYKAL4VBWQ,True,From the United States,Color: Black Orange,B0DMT1FZ3N,

R3CMDPFDM2FPEW,The perfect walking pad!,Ellie,5,"Prior to buying this, I had had an older treadmill that I used for a while, but stopped once I was pregnant and had a baby. I ended up getting rid of it bc it took up way to much space and was staring at me making me feel guilty for not using it...Fast forward 9 months later and I was upset for selling the treadmill bc I was finally feeling ready to get active again! BUT I really didn't want to spend a ton on a treadmill or get something that took up so much space. And as I'm not a runner, I didn't need anything that went too fast. So thank goodness for the popularity of walking pads!!Pros- comes assembled and ready to go, small, easy to move by myself to store, can set different modes (time walked, distance walked) and it can go up to 4mph. One thing I wanted was a walking pad with an incline, and this one has that! there is only one level of incline but that's fine with me! Other reviews said that the noise was loud on the beeps when you turned it on and turned up or down the speed, but I didn't feel like it was loud at all. It is also just what you'd expect for noise when walking.Cons - (none of which are deal breakers imo) the pad itself is shorter than a treadmill so sometimes when I'm walking and not paying the most attention I feel my heels starting to slip off the back end. Mostly this is my own fault and it's not necessarily a con, but just something you need to be ready for. Another issue is that it is slightly too thick to fit under my couch, which is where I was hoping to store it. But I didn't measure before buying and dimensions are listed! So that's my fault. Lastly, when putting the incline up, you flip down two legs at the front, but then you need to unscrew two other ""legs"" to stabilize the pad in the middle so you don't cause warping. I wish those were also just flip down legs too, bc it takes a long time to unscrew and screw those back in. I've just been putting it away with those down bc I always walk with it inclined. But depending on where you store it, those could get in the way.Regardless of those couple small things, I have been extremely happy with this purchase and would absolutely recommend it!","Reviewed in the United States February 20, 2025",AHIHEK3VYH4EQGT7CSL3OHNF2JPQ,True,From the United States,Color: Black Orange,B0DMT1FZ3N,24.0

R1ZI6EM3VBSXFS,GET IT!! It’s the best purchase EVER!!,JennyBee,5,"I cannot describe my “fitness journey” in any other words than- total failure. I have tried it all for over 30 years and I’ve also given it all up. I’ve purchased all the equipment that became dust collectors or a fancy clothing rack. I did all the videos starting with Tae-Bo waayyyy back in the day, to most recently YouTube workouts. I’ve joined gyms and quit gyms. You get the picture, I have done it all. Suddenly I found myself at 50 yrs old, in menopause hell, and heavier than ever. Diets (my old standby) aren’t helping and I couldn’t afford full body liposuction. So I decided to do what I always hear fitness experts say to do. Start simple and walk 10,000 steps a day. I was about to give up on that because every time I attempted 10,000 steps it seemed impossible! Who has that kind of time? And who goes outside when they can’t? There are days when I can’t go outside and walk around town. There are days when I feel like I can’t even get dressed. Whether it be exhaustion, anxiety, cold weather, or all of the above, there are days when I can’t go outside and walk. I was ready to give up again until I saw an Instagram post. The gorgeous 20-something girl was walking on a walking pad and said “This is the only way I can get my 10,000 steps in and I do it because 10,000 steps works!” Hmmmm…. I became curious. I saw her talk on the phone, answer emails and even eat on her walking pad! I was like “This is how you do it!” and I ordered one immediately. Of course, my doubting inner voice, the one who knows all of my attempts and failures, wasted money and embarrassment said “Don’t do this again you’ll regret it!” Thankfully I didn’t listen! I got the walking pad and I haven’t looked back!! It is the best purchase I’ve ever made! Solved all of my problems and addressed all of my weird issues! If I don’t wanna go outside, I walk on my walking pad in the living room of my own home. If I don’t want to get dressed, I walk on my walking pad in my pajamas. If I don’t want to walk because Im tired, I walk on my walking pad slowly. If I haven’t gotten to 10,000 steps, but my husband wants to get back to the show that we are watching together, I can finish them off while we’re watching our show! It has made getting my steps in possible! It’s very quiet, has wheels on the bottom so I can roll it into different rooms, and is soooooo convenient! My balance is better, steps became easier and easier (I was stiff and sore and thigh chafed in the beginning), and now I’m running in intervals on it! I look better, I feel better, and I am falling in love with getting my steps in! HIGHLY RECOMMEND this walking pad!!

R6TOR18F8PYPB,High pitched whistling sound,Matt,3,"The media could not be loaded. As of right now I’m only one day into having this walking pad. It works pretty well but there’s a few things I’m upset about. First, they claim that the belts width is 16.1 inches wide, but when I measured it, it’s barely over 15 inches, which is insanely narrow & I only bought this because I was under the impression that it was OVER 15 inches wide. Second issue I have is when it’s running it makes a horribly annoying high pitched whistle THE WHOLE TIME YOU USE IT. It’s very slightly drowned out by the TV but it’s still headache inducing nonetheless. The belt and unit itself also get slightly warm after light use, for example I was only walking at 3.6mph for 25 minutes and I’m 190lbs for reference. I’ll give this a week or two to see if any of these issues improve, if they don’t I’ll most likely be returning it for a refund.

If you use it for over 45 minutes there is a burning rubber smell that starts. Then it started making extremely loud squeaking sounds when you first turned it on that wouldn't go away until hitting around 20 minutes walking. Every couple months I would take it apart, wipe it down and oil it, and realign the tracks to see if that would help. It never seemed to make a difference. Now the strong smell is happening at 30 minutes of straight walking and the track was getting super hot, along with the squeaking.

It's super lightweight and easy to move despite no wheels. I store it on its side under one side of my desk when I'm not walking.It's a little noisy, but my noise cancelling headsets filter it out well - my colleagues cannot hear it at all! Aside from the motor/belt noise, there's a fan that periodically turns on for 1-2 seconds at a time, and it does so occasionally after stopping the belt to continue cooling the motor for a bit. Once the cooling fan seems done doing its thing, I turn off the power with the side toggle on the walking pad while not in use.Will try to update my review in a few months, but initially happy with my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States February 4, 2025",AHLVWPZ264ZKSQBTXBRHMSXUET7Q,True,From the United States,Color: Red black,B0DFM5VSWF,50.0

R18FUSDXR7YVUB,Great treadmill so far...,Lippy,5,"I have been primarily WFH for several years and decided about a year ago that I wasn't active enough during the work day. I typically walk for about an hour each business day (Mon-Fri) on the treadmill and never set the speed greater than 2.4-3.0 and wanted a treadmill that I could easily put under my standing desk.I've been through 3 Urevo treadmills during that time (first one had an error within the first week of using it, the second worked for several months before the motor seemed to go out, and the third one only lasted 4 months before the motor started getting hot and also producing a plastic burning smell despite applying lubricating oil more often than it recommended to try to keep things working) and decided to try a different brand.Although I have only used this treadmill for a couple days, I wanted to note a couple nice things about it:1. It is very easy to move. It is much (MUCH) lighter than any of my previous under desk treadmills.2. It has a shorter length and width, which is still plenty for me to confidently walk without fear of falling off or hitting the sides (I'm 5'9"" for reference)3. Max speed goes to 3.8, which is higher than I'll ever set it while I'm working.4. It fits easily under my desk (I have a light commercial treadmill at home as well that I use for running on, but I could not easily work from my home gym)5. It doesn't have the ability to incline (the other under desk treadmills I've had DID have this feature, but I never used it to it wasn't something I was concerned about)6. The noise level is about the same as the other under desk treadmills that I've used (which doesn't get picked up the Jabra I use for meetings)7. The cost was much less than it would have been to purchase another Urevo treadmill (paid less than $200)8. Amazon reported that it was selling a high volume of these treadmills, which gives me hope that it will work well for my use case.9. The maintenance (tightening belt and adding oil) is basically the same for all the treadmills I've looked at in the $150-$800 price range (have to add oil directly under the belt once a month for my usage level and they provide an Allen wrench to turn bolts to tighten the belt).10. The treadmill worked great right out of the box.11. The vibration feature is interesting (my kids thought it was fun but I really doubt I'll ever use it)12. I like that it has an app, but I've not needed to set it up (I just track my arm movement/calorie burn based on my Apple Watch)13. Remote for the treadmill came without batteries but worked fine when I added them (2 - AAA batteries)I'm looking forward to using it daily and hope it can last a longer time than the previous under the desk treadmills I've used. If not, there is a 12 month warranty (but I also purchased an additional warranty through Amazon/ASURION in case there are issue).So far, so good!","Reviewed in the United States February 24, 2025",AF4QI5UY6OULPE3S22VI7CNATTRQ,True,From the United States,Color: Red black,B0DFM5VSWF,73.0

R1BO8U4PDATE7E,Works great and super compact!,Alan,5,"I have found that since I started WFH that my activity level had decreased from what it used to be. When I go to the plant to work, I end up doing a lot more walking than I do at home for various reasons. I used to go outside for a walk but that proved to be challenging at times because obviously when I left the house my computer stayed here and I wasn't able to respond quickly to any requests that came my way. I needed a way to get some steps in while I am in my home office.I didn't want to get a traditional treadmill because they are typically pretty large and heavy, not to mention that they can be pretty expensive. I knew that I would end up having to put it in my basement which although more convenient, obviously, than walking outside I still was away from my computer to keep close to the action. Also, often I wake up in the middle of the night with sore joints (arthritis) and a little bit of walking helps reduce this stiffness and soreness. Obviously way more convenient to walk on this versus getting dressed to walk outside, especially if the weather isn't cooperating.Then I discovered this item. This is exactly what it looks like it is -- a small compact, and portable treadmill. First, I will address some things that it doesn't have that may or may not matter to people considering this. It does not have railings, it does not have an adjustable incline, and lastly it doesn't go fast enough to be useful for running. The top speed is 3.8 MPH. That's a very fast walk, but definitely not a run. If these things are important to you than this may not be a good fit for you.However, if you are looking for a very affordable, compact, inexpensive compared to a full-sized treadmill, easy to use and operate, and finally very easy to put away when not in use then this is definitely worth a look.I am 6'4"" inches tall and about 270 lbs. Luckily this device can accommodate up to 350 lbs I believe. However, being tall does cause its own set of challenges -- not the least of which is that I have a fairly long stride compared to many people. However, this walking pad is long enough that I can use it with no issues. If a tall, heavy guy like me can use it then those who are of more average sizes should be just fine.It is essentially 2 devices in one. The first feature and the one that I exclusively use is that it is a walking pad that goes from 0.1 to 3.8 mph. That's fast enough for me. It also is a vibration pad. To be honest I have never really used this, aside from trying it out. I can say that it is pretty powerful, but at present I haven't found a use for that feature.Another feature I really like is that I really like is the included remote control. It would be very inconvenient to have to bend down to change any settings (like speed for example) on the pad itself, which is where the remote comes in. You can adjust the speed of the pad from the remote or shut it off which will end your workout session. Unfortunately, you cannot pause the workout from the remote. However, there is another feature that in my opinion greatly expands upon the remote.There is an associated app which can be downloaded to your smart phone. I have an iPhone so that is all I can speak to. With the app you can pair the walking pad and then a number of other features come into play. Not the least of which is the ability to start, pause, or end the workout. You can also change the speed, and it shows on the display a one-mile track that gives you a visual representation so you can see how far or close you are to getting to the one-mile mark. I really like that feature.Just like a treadmill at a gym you can access pre-programmed workouts or even make your own. There's even a ""Quick Start"" mode where you just hop on and adjust it as you go. It records your workouts as you do them. I have an Apple Watch so that I can record my indoor walk workout to my Apple Fitness app, which is how I keep track of my walking.The one thing that I thought I would miss from having a traditional treadmill was not having the railings. I have a few thoughts on that. What I do is I place my walking pad next to a table or a desk and that is my ""railing"". Secondly, when I walk, I keep the corner of the desk or table in my peripheral vision. That way I will know if I am perhaps not keeping myself centered on the belt. This is probably not as big of deal for people with shorter strides but nevertheless it is good to keep that in mind. Finally, the walking pad sits fairly close to the floor and if I were to slip off the back it is only 2 inches (at most) to the floor. I have never tempted fate, but I am sure that it would not cause me to trip or fall.The final thing I would like to say is that if you are short on space, or if you just don't want to leave something out all the time if you aren't using it, then this walking pad is not that big and weighs under 30 lbs. It can easily be put under a bed, a coach, a desk, or stood up in a closet or corner. It would take 30 seconds to put it away. Turn it off, unplug it, and walk it over to where you want to store it. Try that with a traditional treadmill.To recap -- if you want a great WALKING (speed </= 3.8 mph) pad with tons of features then this is a great choice. I am very happy with my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States April 14, 2025",AETOXCAI6RV4J4V7X3CJUQS5EBBA,True,From the United States,Color: Red black,B0DFM5VSWF,1.0

R14YS4MZDG0795,Love it so far,Abbe,4,"I've been WFH for 10 years and looking for ways to be more active and energized during the workday. This treadmill walking pad is a perfect size for my walking gait (I'm 5'4""). The remote works well and makes it easy to start/stop and toggle the speed up/down. It's super lightweight and easy to move despite no wheels. I store it on its side under one side of my desk when I'm not walking.It's a little noisy, but my noise cancelling headsets filter it out well - my colleagues cannot hear it at all! Aside from the motor/belt noise, there's a fan that periodically turns on for 1-2 seconds at a time, and it does so occasionally after stopping the belt to continue cooling the motor for a bit. Once the cooling fan seems done doing its thing, I turn off the power with the side toggle on the walking pad while not in use.Will try to update my review in a few months, but initially happy with my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States February 4, 2025",AHLVWPZ264ZKSQBTXBRHMSXUET7Q,True,From the United States,Color: Red black,B0DFM5VSWF,50.0

R18FUSDXR7YVUB,Great treadmill so far...,Lippy,5,"I have been primarily WFH for several years and decided about a year ago that I wasn't active enough during the work day. I typically walk for about an hour each business day (Mon-Fri) on the treadmill and never set the speed greater than 2.4-3.0 and wanted a treadmill that I could easily put under my standing desk.I've been through 3 Urevo treadmills during that time (first one had an error within the first week of using it, the second worked for several months before the motor seemed to go out, and the third one only lasted 4 months before the motor started getting hot and also producing a plastic burning smell despite applying lubricating oil more often than it recommended to try to keep things working) and decided to try a different brand.Although I have only used this treadmill for a couple days, I wanted to note a couple nice things about it:1. It is very easy to move. It is much (MUCH) lighter than any of my previous under desk treadmills.2. It has a shorter length and width, which is still plenty for me to confidently walk without fear of falling off or hitting the sides (I'm 5'9"" for reference)3. Max speed goes to 3.8, which is higher than I'll ever set it while I'm working.4. It fits easily under my desk (I have a light commercial treadmill at home as well that I use for running on, but I could not easily work from my home gym)5. It doesn't have the ability to incline (the other under desk treadmills I've had DID have this feature, but I never used it to it wasn't something I was concerned about)6. The noise level is about the same as the other under desk treadmills that I've used (which doesn't get picked up the Jabra I use for meetings)7. The cost was much less than it would have been to purchase another Urevo treadmill (paid less than $200)8. Amazon reported that it was selling a high volume of these treadmills, which gives me hope that it will work well for my use case.9. The maintenance (tightening belt and adding oil) is basically the same for all the treadmills I've looked at in the $150-$800 price range (have to add oil directly under the belt once a month for my usage level and they provide an Allen wrench to turn bolts to tighten the belt).10. The treadmill worked great right out of the box.11. The vibration feature is interesting (my kids thought it was fun but I really doubt I'll ever use it)12. I like that it has an app, but I've not needed to set it up (I just track my arm movement/calorie burn based on my Apple Watch)13. Remote for the treadmill came without batteries but worked fine when I added them (2 - AAA batteries)I'm looking forward to using it daily and hope it can last a longer time than the previous under the desk treadmills I've used. If not, there is a 12 month warranty (but I also purchased an additional warranty through Amazon/ASURION in case there are issue).So far, so good!","Reviewed in the United States February 24, 2025",AF4QI5UY6OULPE3S22VI7CNATTRQ,True,From the United States,Color: Red black,B0DFM5VSWF,73.0

Aside from the motor/belt noise, there's a fan that periodically turns on for 1-2 seconds at a time, and it does so occasionally after stopping the belt to continue cooling the motor for a bit. Once the cooling fan seems done doing its thing, I turn off the power with the side toggle on the walking pad while not in use.Will try to update my review in a few months, but initially happy with my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States February 4, 2025",AHLVWPZ264ZKSQBTXBRHMSXUET7Q,True,From the United States,Color: Red black,B0DFM5VSWF,50.0

R18FUSDXR7YVUB,Great treadmill so far...,Lippy,5,"I have been primarily WFH for several years and decided about a year ago that I wasn't active enough during the work day. I typically walk for about an hour each business day (Mon-Fri) on the treadmill and never set the speed greater than 2.4-3.0 and wanted a treadmill that I could easily put under my standing desk.I've been through 3 Urevo treadmills during that time (first one had an error within the first week of using it, the second worked for several months before the motor seemed to go out, and the third one only lasted 4 months before the motor started getting hot and also producing a plastic burning smell despite applying lubricating oil more often than it recommended to try to keep things working) and decided to try a different brand.Although I have only used this treadmill for a couple days, I wanted to note a couple nice things about it:1. It is very easy to move. It is much (MUCH) lighter than any of my previous under desk treadmills.2. It has a shorter length and width, which is still plenty for me to confidently walk without fear of falling off or hitting the sides (I'm 5'9"" for reference)3. Max speed goes to 3.8, which is higher than I'll ever set it while I'm working.4. It fits easily under my desk (I have a light commercial treadmill at home as well that I use for running on, but I could not easily work from my home gym)5. It doesn't have the ability to incline (the other under desk treadmills I've had DID have this feature, but I never used it to it wasn't something I was concerned about)6. The noise level is about the same as the other under desk treadmills that I've used (which doesn't get picked up the Jabra I use for meetings)7. The cost was much less than it would have been to purchase another Urevo treadmill (paid less than $200)8. Amazon reported that it was selling a high volume of these treadmills, which gives me hope that it will work well for my use case.9. The maintenance (tightening belt and adding oil) is basically the same for all the treadmills I've looked at in the $150-$800 price range (have to add oil directly under the belt once a month for my usage level and they provide an Allen wrench to turn bolts to tighten the belt).10. The treadmill worked great right out of the box.11. The vibration feature is interesting (my kids thought it was fun but I really doubt I'll ever use it)12. I like that it has an app, but I've not needed to set it up (I just track my arm movement/calorie burn based on my Apple Watch)13. Remote for the treadmill came without batteries but worked fine when I added them (2 - AAA batteries)I'm looking forward to using it daily and hope it can last a longer time than the previous under the desk treadmills I've used. If not, there is a 12 month warranty (but I also purchased an additional warranty through Amazon/ASURION in case there are issue).So far, so good!","Reviewed in the United States February 24, 2025",AF4QI5UY6OULPE3S22VI7CNATTRQ,True,From the United States,Color: Red black,B0DFM5VSWF,73.0

Mine is not loud at all, I have sensory issues and it doesn't even close to bother me, it's not eveb as loud as a dryer running. I can hear my TV and music fine with it running without having to turn it up.Second it's lightweight, easy to move, my only dislike in the actual device size department is the cord length is super short, I wish it was longer. In the area I have it I have to plug in a small extension cord, not a deal breaker by any means but mildly inconvenient.Third works perfect, remote is easy to use as are actual controls easy to learn and use and everything. Threw some Velcro into the remote and onto the side of the pad so I can pop the remote onto there after use before sliding it back into place, so I don't lose said remote.The pad itself shows your steps and everything on the side, the companion app is stupid, buggy, laggy, and everything else so no real use in using that, it got removed from my phone fairly quickly when I saw how ridiculous it was.All in all, great price, easy to take out and just plug in and go. Delivery may be spotty if you order but that's not the sellers fault, amazing delivery itself has been absolutely abysmal lately.Highly recommend ordering, I got it because I'm disabled and I needed a way to do some exercises in my home but refused to buy a full treadmill that was expensive and takes up to much room.","Reviewed in the United States April 6, 2025",AFRCPLWX4LBOZ47XQCJWIJM5FXDA,True,From the United States,Color: Red black,B0DFM5VSWF,30.0

R29S2ZSKB26NNV,Must have,Myla,5,"MY HONEST REVIEW:I spent almost a year going back and forth with myself about getting a walking pad because it’s expensive and I didn’t want it to be one of those things that I use for a month and then forget about it.I finally got it and it’s been such a blessing. I gained some weight and that was the main reason I decided to make the purchase.I’m happy to report that I’ve been losing the weight. My Apple Watch fitness trends are night and day, I get over 10k steps a day, and that alone gives me the motivation to stay consistent. Sometimes I won’t use it on a weekend and that’s okay.Something else I want to share is I’ve been struggling with lower back pain for the last year. As soon as I woke up in the morning my back was hurting. I changed my mattress thinking that was the problem and it didn’t help. I really was miserable.Well, the other day at the grocery store with my husband all of a sudden it hit me that I haven’t been having back pain anymore. I didn’t even realize it, which is crazy.The only thing that has changed is that I’ve been walking a lot more, so I’m convinced it was due to not being active enough!Besides losing weight and having no back pain, I genuinely love waking up and getting a work out in, even if it’s just walking. I feel so good and accomplished. The speed goes up to 3.8 which at first I thought that was kinda low, but it’s actually perfect. I walk at 3.0 and work my way up to 3.5, I walk at least 1 mile, but aim for 2 most mornings (3 total for the day) and I work up a huge sweat.As for the walking pad itself-PROS:*It has wheels in the front which makes moving it easy.* it’s not very big so it easily fits under the couch* It comes fully assembled* it’s sleek looking so you don’t have an eye sore in the middle of the living roomCONS:* the cable to plug it in is rather short, so an extension cord will be needed* the walking pad isn’t as long as it would be on a treadmill, so if you have longer legs you’ll probably take shorter stridesPersonally, so much goodness has coming from having this walking pad that the cons don’t affect me. I love the way I feel physically and mentally. I love that I don’t have to go out in the heat if I don’t want to. I highly recommend this to everyone.","Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2024",AHVIXZVOVUVPFUFOH3TEDPSVNRLA,True,From the United States,Color: black,B0C3QY37Y8,745.0

After a lot of research, I decided to try this walking pad, and it has completely transformed my workday.First off, it’s compact and easy to store. I slide it under my couch when I’m not using it, which is perfect for my small home office setup. It’s also surprisingly quiet—I can take calls and participate in meetings without any background noise issues.The speed range is ideal for both a slow walk while typing and a brisker pace when I’m just listening to meetings or brainstorming. The remote is simple to use, and setup was basically plug-and-play. No complicated assembly, just unfold (if needed) and start walking.I was worried that walking while working would feel awkward, but after a couple of days, it became second nature. Now, I’m getting my steps in without even thinking about it!

R3BVDGB5NBYQ2I,Adequate,Kimberly B,3,"I only use this as a back up to walking outside when the weather is bad. The pros: It works, and it was very easy to set up and go right out of the box. It's small enough to move and roll under a bed without much hassle.The cons: After using it, I wish I had spent a bit more money for a nicer walking pad. The fact that it doesn't have a arm bar/handle plays a larger factor than I anticipated. If I don't stare directly down at it, there is a natural tendency to move a little from side to side while walking and can feel a bit off balance. I wouldn't hold onto the bar, but it would be nice to have one just to touch and keep or correct balance. I have situated the walking pad next to a wall and that has kept it from being too dangerous, but it's not ideal. I understand that I willingly bought it without a bar, but I'm saying that if I had to do it again, I would choose to get one with a bar/handle. Aside from that, you can't turn it on without the remote. I wish there was also a switch on the machine itself as a back up, because what if the remote stops working, gets lost, or simply the batteries dying when you want to walk would be inconvenient. I question how long it will hold up. I've been using it for about a month, anywhere from 18-30 minutes at a time (which I don't consider a lot) and I'm hearing noises and creaks. I hope it lasts, but won't be surprised if it doesn't. Finally, I am 5 foot 5 inches, and the walking area is just barely long enough for me. I often step down onto the top of the machine if I start striding too long/fast. I can't imagine anyone taller than me or with a long stride, man or woman, being able to comfortably do a brisk walk on this without it being dangerous.Overall, at around 100 dollars, this was very cheap, and it does work and do what it says. It goes up to 3.8 miles/hour (which is not enough to run, but is enough to get a brisk walk). I keep the little legs down so it stays at a very subtle incline. I'm not sure it makes a difference, but they are there. I personally would not buy this again or recommend it, but if money and/or space is a factor for you, and you are less than 5'5"", it may work for getting your steps in. If you wanted to use it under a standing desk for very slow movement, it also might be fine for that.","Reviewed in the United States February 14, 2025",AGOSR3XWSOXO3B4SEHRTRA3QX63Q,True,From the United States,Color: black,B0CJ4QLFLT,18.0

R3BVDGB5NBYQ2I,Adequate,Kimberly B,3,"I only use this as a back up to walking outside when the weather is bad. The pros: It works, and it was very easy to set up and go right out of the box. It's small enough to move and roll under a bed without much hassle.The cons: After using it, I wish I had spent a bit more money for a nicer walking pad. The fact that it doesn't have a arm bar/handle plays a larger factor than I anticipated. If I don't stare directly down at it, there is a natural tendency to move a little from side to side while walking and can feel a bit off balance. I wouldn't hold onto the bar, but it would be nice to have one just to touch and keep or correct balance. I have situated the walking pad next to a wall and that has kept it from being too dangerous, but it's not ideal. I understand that I willingly bought it without a bar, but I'm saying that if I had to do it again, I would choose to get one with a bar/handle. Aside from that, you can't turn it on without the remote. I wish there was also a switch on the machine itself as a back up, because what if the remote stops working, gets lost, or simply the batteries dying when you want to walk would be inconvenient.

I didn’t expect anything high quality for the price, I was just looking for a low price walking pad with good reviews. I feel like the reviews are quite misleading. It’s very small and not super sturdy. I’m only 5’2 and I feel like it’s not long enough to get a full stride and it’s really narrow. I’ve been walking at 3.0 with the incline feet. It works but you definitely won’t be running and the belt slips and gets off centered very easily. There’s instructions to center the belt which only seems to last a little bit and then it’s off again. The beeping noise is loud when selecting the speed, but the machine itself is quiet. Overall, I wish I would have waited and saved up a little more. It’ll work for now, but I’ll want to upgrade eventually.","Reviewed in the United States February 21, 2025",AEZYYMS5OK3BMK2BETX5D64ZXNCA,True,From the United States,Color: incline(No handle),B0CJ4QLFLT,1.0

It doesn't work without the remote, so it's now just a treadmill shaped piece of junk taking up space. Absolute waste of money.Things I didn't like about it anyway: it is too narrow, which causes an uncomfortable gait. The power cord is only a few feet long, limiting the area it can be used.

It forces you to take very small awkward steps if you walk any faster than 1 mile per hour. I saw the 48” when purchasing and should have looked even closer, the entire pad is nowhere near 48”. More like 33” of walking space. I’m 5’10” and I constantly feel my feet hit the back edge. Also very narrow, my feet hit the side edge causing it to slow down.The cord is also very short. I have to run an extension cord to be able to not face a wall.It’s extremely loud. Just to turn the thing on or turn up the speed, you have to click through several extremely loud beeps. Not great since I’m using this at night.I’ve used it for maybe a total of 3 hours, I’m well under the weight limit and it’s started making a creaking noise like it’s not going to last more than a month or 2.Update- seller is responsive, I would return item if it wasn’t so big but have found that almost all of these walking pads are this length unfortunately. I wish they’d make them just a few inches longer.

R3BVDGB5NBYQ2I,Adequate,Kimberly B,3,"I only use this as a back up to walking outside when the weather is bad. The pros: It works, and it was very easy to set up and go right out of the box. It's small enough to move and roll under a bed without much hassle.The cons: After using it, I wish I had spent a bit more money for a nicer walking pad. The fact that it doesn't have a arm bar/handle plays a larger factor than I anticipated. If I don't stare directly down at it, there is a natural tendency to move a little from side to side while walking and can feel a bit off balance. I wouldn't hold onto the bar, but it would be nice to have one just to touch and keep or correct balance. I have situated the walking pad next to a wall and that has kept it from being too dangerous, but it's not ideal. I understand that I willingly bought it without a bar, but I'm saying that if I had to do it again, I would choose to get one with a bar/handle. Aside from that, you can't turn it on without the remote. I wish there was also a switch on the machine itself as a back up, because what if the remote stops working, gets lost, or simply the batteries dying when you want to walk would be inconvenient. I question how long it will hold up. I've been using it for about a month, anywhere from 18-30 minutes at a time (which I don't consider a lot) and I'm hearing noises and creaks. I hope it lasts, but won't be surprised if it doesn't. Finally, I am 5 foot 5 inches, and the walking area is just barely long enough for me. I often step down onto the top of the machine if I start striding too long/fast. I can't imagine anyone taller than me or with a long stride, man or woman, being able to comfortably do a brisk walk on this without it being dangerous.Overall, at around 100 dollars, this was very cheap, and it does work and do what it says. It goes up to 3.8 miles/hour (which is not enough to run, but is enough to get a brisk walk). I keep the little legs down so it stays at a very subtle incline. I'm not sure it makes a difference, but they are there. I personally would not buy this again or recommend it, but if money and/or space is a factor for you, and you are less than 5'5"", it may work for getting your steps in. If you wanted to use it under a standing desk for very slow movement, it also might be fine for that.","Reviewed in the United States February 14, 2025",AGOSR3XWSOXO3B4SEHRTRA3QX63Q,True,From the United States,Color: black,B0CJ4QLFLT,18.0

Then the belt started to squeak when starting and eventually got better. I tried the lubricant but that didn’t help. I even bought more lubricant thinking it needed more since I used it nearly every day. Next when you started it the belt would stop when you stood in it for a second or two and take it a little bit to get going and my stride was messed up for the first 30 seconds (give or take). Then it started to smell hot after about a mile in and I began to notice it wasn’t was fast as it used to be. It would be too hot to touch when done with a walk, and I would set it upright to keep the heat off the floor. Today, my husband was walking and it sparked and the smell was super intense even an hour later. I had also tried walking with the incline to see if that would make a difference and it did not, it was still slow and smelled hot like melting plastic. I would not recommend purchasing this one.

They tell you to adjust the walk pad which I later found out is not something you should do unless something is already wrong.It runs fine but after about 20 minutes it started to make a weird noise. I got off and lubricated it and proceeded to use it again. Another weirder noise started so I got off and started to twist the screws. That did not help.The customer service number is listed all over the equipment so I called for help. Got a voice mail once and then called right back and got someone with a crackling phone line who gave me directions on how to fix the machine that made it worse and the belt flipped over on one side. She then told me they couldn’t help unless I sent an email and waited 2 days for a response. Not acceptable. I paid money for it. So because I’m comfortable putting things together and taking them apart, I took it apart and fixed the belt, put it back together and resolved the issue myself. Mind you it’s not even 24 hours since I received the item.After 5 minutes of running after it was fixed it started to make a thumping sound. I did not stop the machine and the thumping slowly died down and has now stopped.

I really wanted this to work, but you shouldn’t have to adjust a belt for the amount of times that I had to do - to adjust it when this is supposed to be brand new. I received this yesterday, April 1 and I started using it right away and the first thing I noticed was that noise that you get when the belt is off. No big deal, all it needs is a little adjustment – easy enough. However, after adjusting the belt, it continue to move, again no big deal, just continue to adjust.

I saw this, sent her the link and she instantly wanted it. She says she really likes it, it is easy to use, the belt goes smoothly and when it’s not in use very easy to store and put out of the way.

I used it as soon as it came in. I work from home, and placed it under my desk and walked on it as I worked. Before I knew it, I walked 2 miles. My 6', 240 lb husband ran on this treadmill and it was so sturdy and performed so well! It goes up to 7.6 mph! And when you push the stop button, it isn't a hard stop, but a gradual one. If you pull the emergency cord, it is a hard stop. The quality far exceeded my expectations! The only cons I saw was that it was a little heavier at almost 60 lbs when I saw most were under 50 lbs and that the stability bar does not lock when it's folded down. So when the treadmill is being stored upright, the pad part itself can move forward from the wall, away from the bar. We created a home made tie down strap, attaching it with a bungee cord hook to the metal bar underneath the pad so that it stays put against the wall behind the door, preventing any accidents from happening. There is a little slack so there isn't a lot of tension on that bar (and could possibly damage or bend it) which is what we wanted. It works well. Just have to also remember that when you're moving the treadmill, to hold the walking pad part and not just the stability bar. Bought the Amazon 2 year protection plan for $26.99 but learned that it comes with a one year manufacturer warranty, which was a nice surprise, as it wasn't listed.

R17NH2HO8MWIHU,Review After 1 Year of Use,migdalia neste,5,"***UPDATED REVIEW***After a year of use, I still REALLY like this treadmill. It's helped me easily reach my daily step goal while being able to continue working, since I use it with my standing desk.However in full transparency, my treadmill started to emit a burning smell when I used it (after about 8 months of use). My usage during those last few months was as follows: 4-5 days a week/ 2-3x a day /1 hour at a time. I usually used it on speed 2.2 - 2.4 when working, or speed 3.4 for an hour when not working. The burning smell started out gradually and over time grew very strong. Then one day (almost a year to the date of purchase) I walked briskly for about an hour on the treadmill, but the burning smell was extremely strong so I cut my hour short. I turned the machine off and came back to use it about 5 hours later & it would not work anymore. When I turned the power button on it gave me a E5 then an E6 error and the belt would not move.I emailed Urevo Customer Service with my Amazon order number, since I was still within their 1 year warranty, and got a prompt response. They asked me to go through a couple of troubleshooting steps, send a video of what was occurring, and take a picture of the sticker on the unit. I did all of those things, and Urevo shipped me a brand new treadmill. I reached out to them on 2/20/23 and received my new treadmill on 3/1/23. I am extremely satisfied with their customer service!I am a little concerned about the longevity of the treadmill, and wish I knew what caused it to burn out. I really hope this one doesn't do the same thing. But if it does, I hope it's within the 1 year warranty :)***END OF UPDATE***ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW.I REALLY like this treadmill. Despite some of the negative reviews I went ahead and took a chance on this one due to it having controls on the raise-able arm and also a separate remote. I wish it was all black instead of orange and black, but what can ya do??Anyways here’s the nitty gritty. I’ve owned this thing for about 2 months and so far it’s perfect. It operates exactly as is stated.Set up: Easy! Took it out of the box, added the lubricant as suggested, attached the plug & voila! Was super confused at first when it wouldn’t turn on then realized there’s an On/Off switch underneath.Usage: I use it in 10 minute intervals for brisk walking (3.0-3.4 setting) throughout the day, 5-6 days a week. Sometimes if I’m watching TV I’ll use it for 20-30 minutes at a time. I turn it off by the off switch after each usage (just so it doesn’t zap electricity - maybe this matters, maybe it doesn’t 🤷🏽‍♀️). And I unplug at the end of each day. I have not had any error messages or any need to adjust the belt at all.Storage: Pictures attached show this thing next to my dining room table, and it is not as small as you think it would be. It’s pretty heavy too. That being said- I, a 5’4” woman, can lift this thing and stash it in it’s “put away” space. I store mine standing upright, and have had no issues with that. When you get this thing up on it’s wheels it rolls really easily. I saw someone say that the wheels damaged their floor while rolling. I have wood floors and have not had that experience.MAJOR FYI/CON: When we unboxed this, we could not find a plug to plug it in to. Every plug we tried, this thing tripped the circuit and caused the power to go out to a certain part of the house. I really panicked about this, thinking I had bought a piece of expensive equipment I wasn’t even going to be able to use 😭. That being said, we have these floor sockets in certain areas of our home and that are not on the same circuit with anything else. These are the ONLY plugs in my house this thing works on. This works for me because the plug is in the area I planned to use the treadmill in anyway. But be very careful about this so you're not wasting your money!Otherwise, I couldn’t recommend enough.

R1E1JS4UOYFGOL,Convenient and compact,quite-yes,4,"This has been a great treadmill for intermittent use. It's very slim, folds down into a compact height, has a shelf for holding a phone or book, has good default intervals of MPH and a magnetic emergency stop you can clip to your clothes, and is generally user friendly in the interface. It's also nice that the main on/off switch is hidden away so small kids can't accidentally turn it on.The only tough thing is adding the lubricant to grease the belt every few months. The instructions describe lifting the belt manually to get the lubricant as close to center as possible, which is really difficult. And the bottle that it comes in makes it hard to see how many drops you've applied. An easier way to get around this is to have your own flat tool and apply the right amount of drops to it, then slip it under the belt as far in as possible.Another minor issue is that adjusting the belt when it becomes off-center involves rereading the instructions to recollect which side to insert the allen wrench and which direction to turn it a certain number of times, etc. But once completed, it's a relatively reliable fix.Latest issue: The treadmill doesn't really mention a maximum speed, but after using it once going a few MPH higher than the top preset for an extended intense workout, the machine kind of bugged out a little and then started randomly stopping at times, which is concerning in terms of safety/balance. An EO2 error message is now popping up about changing out the motor.

The issue is the walking pad will not work if the remote is not working I don’t know if it’s Bluetooth connected, but there is no universal remote that will work with this. The pad will turn on, but you will not be able to turn up the speed or anything like that without the remote. I’m on my second pad because they sent me a new one and I am experiencing the same issue at this point. It’s extremely frustrating because I don’t have a return box to send the big heavy walking pad in.","Reviewed in the United States April 11, 2025",AEVR5Z2KTOHFMLGMHVDA4CEBVIVQ,True,From the United States,Color: Silver,B0DL2LM8F9,1.0

RIH6KUKCYNCN3,Great walking treadmill,Haley S.,5,"The media could not be loaded. This treadmill was exactly what I was looking for! It is a very nice and sleek design. It doesn’t take up that much space. I am 5‘2“ and it has plenty of belt for my stride. The speed seems very comparable to a regular treadmill. The incline is enough to feel a burn Without being concerned about balance since there is no arm bar. There was no set up or installation at all. You unpack the treadmill and then you plug it in and you’re good to go. I would definitely recommend it if you have a limited living space, if you’re looking for a good alternative to walking outside, or you just want to get some more steps in. You could probably get a light jog at the top speed, but ultimately this is a walking pad so I would not buy it if your goal is to use it for running.

Very unsafe.I just started the process of the return, so just a heads up - keep the box until you know you're gunna keep it. It's required for the return.***UPDATE***I originally posted this as a 2 star item. I still agree with that, but am changing it to a 5 star because of this companies customer service and their need to make you happy.

RIPH6DSAZN9Z1,"Too narrow, too short!",Kathy Catir,3,"So, as far as quality it does seem sturdy, and to be built well, and the display is big and very visible, those are the pros.So, now for the cons.. The belt is only 15 in wide and I think about 35 in Long. Too narrow, too short. I have short legs, and when I'm walking on it, I find myself stepping on the display, but then when I adjust to go further back, some times I felt my heels hit the back. The belt needed to be about 5 inches wider, and about 10 inches longer and that would have been perfect. Also, when the time is up, and the belt stops, at first it seems like it's a decent decline in the speed but then once it gets to a certain point it catches. I lost my balance, and almost fell off the thing. The incline part is okay, except you only get one height of incline, but I can live with that. There are also instructions for you to adjust and tighten the belt, and it also requires oil to keep it lubricated. I owned a treadmill years ago and never had to do any of this. When the treadmill slowed down, it slowed down very smoothly to a stop, never a jerking jolt. Oh, and make sure you don't lose the remote, because that's the only way to operate it. You need to keep the remote on you, because you can't stop it without it. Good luck getting off it without the remote. My suggestions, if you're looking for a walking pad, in addition to the belt being longer and wider, would be to get one that has a handle. That way if it jerks when you're slowing down you have something to hang on to..I did request a return, but unfortunately purchasing this will only give you a free delivery, NOT a free return. When I submitted the request to the company, they were polite, and said it would be too difficult to return, because of the size and weight. I looked online to see how much it would cost to send a package like that back and it would have cost around $70, and that would be my responsibility. Now in all fairness to the company they did give me a $25 refund and I did get to keep the walking pad, but I'm going to have to figure out how to use it without the potential risk of falling off of it and hurting myself. I have to say, this was a very regrettable purchase...Update..These walking pads are meant to be used with desks. I guess I didn't realize that when I purchased it. I have to admit, I think this was more about a lack of me doing my homework.. Also, when they saw my review, they reached out to me immediately.

I'm only 5'2"" and have a very short stride, yet I can barely take a full stride without stepping on the plastic up front or the roller on the back. Lastly, it's very noise as far as creeks; the actual rolling of the track is quiet but boy does the actual pad creek with every step. I am within the weight limits so it shouldn't be from that.

The 2-in-1 feature is nice—you can use it as a regular treadmill for light jogging or just as an under-desk walker when you’re knocking out emails.The foot massage boards on the sides are a cool little bonus, didn’t expect to actually use them much, but they’re nice for giving your feet a break in between sessions. It runs pretty quietly too, which is important if you’re using it while on calls or don’t wanna disturb anyone else at home.The deep silver color gives it a modern look that fits in well without sticking out too much.

Its slim design allows for easy storage and portability. The device features remote control operation for speed adjustments. It's a little noisy but no more than any other treadmill I've used. The walking surface is nice but narrower than gym treadmills I've used. This isn't a treadmill to do any medium to high intensity cardio but is perfectly suited to walking indoors. I like that it folds away for easy storage making it good for those of us who take daily walks but need an option to do so inside when the weather is bad. Could be a little more robust, but good value for the price.","Reviewed in the United States March 14, 2025",AFAOHXWGUQ42P2QZVLLKVP4H3ZVQ,False,From the United States,,B0DJ2W38GW,

R13QGIS8A6L03H,Not bad. Read if you never had one before...,Philip Maschke,4,"The media could not be loaded. I wanted one of these for my office for a while. Now that I have it, I have come to realize that it doesn't work as well as I wish it would. Not a diss about this product but things to consider as you consider getting something like it.First off, price seemed good for what you get. It's very slim but quite heavy. It has a cheapish plastic remote to turn it on and off and adjust speed which is nice. I just wish it had a pause button so you can either jump off or get something done quickly then resume. Instead you have to stop then re-set the speed.I didn't think it was too loud but in my office where I have a cubicle I prefer not to use it because of the noise. One time I was alone while I used it and my supervisor said he could hear it in his office. So...you know what that means...On a personal note I couldn't really use it much because I couldn't get anything done. First, my standing desk doesn't go high enough so when walking the hands are awkwardly hanging down while trying to use the mouse and keyboard. It's like a weird in-between. When I did try to do some work the whole table also shook so doing precise design work was a nogo. The only time this was useful was during a virtual meeting where it was only about listening. Since taking notes wasn't working well. Also, when being asked to respond that pause button would habe been great. Instead I had to jump off so I wouldn't sound like I'm walking into work. Alas, most of my workout wasn't captured by my fitness watch since the hands can't swing while you walk and work...never realized that until I tried this.Also, during that meeting I could smell something that smelled like burned rubber. Can't tell if it's the usual smell of items that just needed to go through a break in period or if the rubber of the walking strip was getting hot. Will have to keep an eye out.Lastly, at about 6 foot and a 34 inseam i was able to stay in the center pretty good and only had some occasional issues stepping to far up/back but at least I never tripped.For a home environment this could be nice. And maybe I'll let my wife try it at hear place of employment. Overall it works and does not come with many bells and whistles which is fine. But beware of your work environment and your colleagues when considering this.","Reviewed in the United States March 11, 2025",AEK36MUMFHRI3JNRRDCAULLSX3UA,False,From the United States,,B0DJ2W38GW,1.0

It has a compact size, which is perfect for my limited space since I don't have room for a full-size treadmill. I love that it can be easily stored standing up against a wall, though it’s too big to store under a desk.The assembly was simple and straightforward, requiring only the reattachment of side brackets with one screw, a washer, and the provided Allen wrench. It came with a small remote, a spare coin battery, and extra lubricant, which is a nice touch.However, my wife finds the treadmill is a bit heavy to move around—just under 50 lbs. While it has wheels on one side for mobility, they don’t work as smoothly as I’d like.Another feature I enjoy is the versatility of the treadmill. It has a traditional walking/running side that flips over to reveal a massage side. The massage side takes a little getting used to, but it’s a nice bonus.One issue I noticed is that the listing photos mention a 330 lb capacity, but the manual lists the maximum weight as 265 lbs, which is a bit misleading.I removed one star due to the wheels not rolling smoothly, the cord being a bit on the short side, and the discrepancy in the weight capacity listed.","Reviewed in the United States March 8, 2025",AERH7DRTEUCMEFIFVYQRZPTMD5BQ,False,From the United States,,B0DJ2W38GW,

RWACPTBPTLWNG,Frustrating Defective Product with Poor Support,Product Person,1,"I had high hopes for this treadmill, but unfortunately, my experience has been extremely disappointing. From the moment it arrived, the treadmill has produced a loud, distracting noise every time I step on the right side. After multiple attempts at contacting LifeSpan Fitness support and diligently following their instructions—tightening the belt, centering adjustments, and even removing and inspecting the motor cover—the problem remains unresolved.I've invested considerable time and effort into trying to fix this defective product myself, following every troubleshooting step provided by the company's customer service team. Despite my clear video evidence showing the persistent issue, the company's support response has been sluggish, repetitive, and ineffective.

R3FSD44Q1VO74N,Great product and customer service,Bob Loblaw,5,"I've had this for about 5 months now, and I've really gotten my money's worth. I used it intermittently at first, but over the last month I've been using it for about 3 hours a day at 2.5-3.5mph and have lost 10 lbs. When I was looking at which treadmill to buy, I researched different models for several weeks and decided to spend a little extra getting this one because of the maintenance-free belt and the ability to pair this with a cheap IKEA standing desk. I love this because I can completely zone out for hours while playing video games at my desk, and before I know it, I've walked 10 miles and have satisfied my calorie burn goal for the day.The customer service is also superb. I've had a couple of issues with my treadmill where a strange noise was coming from it (first I think was a belt issue and second was a motor issue or loose screw), and the company mailed me the replacement parts and scheduled for a technician to come by and fix it (both free of charge).The only thing I would change about this is the weight. It's really heavy and isn't meant to be moved around the house too often. I keep it in my home office, but it would've been great if it was light enough to move to the TV room and back whenever I needed.I'm completely satisfied with this purchase and would absolutely recommend it to anyone who's considering it.","Reviewed in the United States September 25, 2017",AGG5U47TCXAEMMWNYRXO4OTHSAXA,True,From the United States,,B0BMMC4NST,37.0

R2ZHORIU7RM9LY,"READ THIS: it's a good product, with serious caveats",Taylor Ellwood,4,"Please read this and understand what the tradeoffs are before you buy! tl;dr - product is good value for money, customer service is abysmal, console confusing, I will walk you through workarounds.TREADMILL. The treadmill itself is wonderful. It's very quiet, and the loudest noise is my actual footfalls, which according to my colleagues they can scarcely hear - they don't even notice, they were saying ""oh, yeah, I guess I can hear it faintly"" when I asked, but probably wouldn't notice at all if I hadn't asked. The TR1000 is compact and fits nicely under my not-that-wide standing desk. It's very sturdy, good construction, easy to set up, comes packaged carefully. I've been using it for a few hours a day to start and have had no issues at all - I'll update when I have more to report on durability.The CONSOLE is the problem. It's very antiquated in design. It looks like it was constructed in the 80s, looks almost like an old school super nintendo controller but bigger and clunkier. It has an incredibly annoying beep when you hit any button, including the button to take the speed up, and its default speed is 0.6 mph. That meant that to get it up to 2.0 mph, every single time you start it you have to hear about 20 annoying little beeps to enter your weight (non-optional, you MUST do it every time), start it, and bump it up 0.1 at a time to your chosen speed. You can change this in settings, but I couldn't access settings (I have a fix below). Finally, it doesn't turn off. it'll rotate through time, steps, calories etc forever after you get off the treadmill - it's still doing it the following morning. You have to remove the safety pin to get it to the default, which is three lit-up lines. If you're using this in your bedroom, that light is going to annoy you for sure. The only way to turn the panel off entirely is to unplug the console from the treadmill port, which is at the front of the treadmill and hard to access.TRACKING. The weight option only goes up to 180 even though it's rated for higher weights so I wouldn't rely on this thing for accuracy on calories. The time and step counter are very accurate, but they reset when you remove the safety pin - and removing the safety pin is the only way to turn off the console. You're supposed to use their app to track all that data over time, but according to reviews it's terrible. I'd use a fitness tracker on your ankle instead if you want an accurate step/time/calorie count.CHANGING SETTINGS - this was the big problem. I could not for the life of me get to the personal settings to turn off the beep. I used the manual, I looked up other people's answers online, and still when I pressed and held the two buttons I'm instructed to hold, nothing happened. Finally had to contact a guy on Red dit who does repairs and he finally got the answer: you hold the Stop/Pause button FIRST for about a second, THEN press and hold the ^ button. I don't know how you're supposed to intuit that but I'll add it to the Q&A section for anyone else struggling. You can, in personal settings, turn off the beep and set it to start at the speed you were walking at previously.CUSTOMER SERVICE. This is the huge caveat. It's nonexistent. The phone number in the manual is a disconnect. The other numbers I found online were all disconnects. The number provided by Amazon does work but went straight to voicemail. I sent multiple emails and chat messages and a week later, have no response. My issue was obviously pretty fixable, just this weird quirk of the controls, but for a week I was worried the console was broken and needed to be returned, and I couldn't even get hold of someone to return it! If you have ANY concerns about being able to reach customer service, you do not want to buy this product.HELP. If you've already bought it, the way I finally got some help was to go through a guy on red dit with the handle simplefitnessrepair. He got in touch with customer service right away because he's a seller with them. If you're currently shopping for a treadmill, I cannot, cannot recommend going through that guy highly enough. He was incredible. This kind of customer service we're all hoping for and that doesn't seem to exist anymore. My husband wants a treadmill desk now and I'll be using him to purchase it.I hope all of this is helpful to you in your purchase. This is a big one! Lifespan is sort of upper-mid in options - it's good quality for the money, but if you want to invest in something where you can actually get repairs/your warranty serviced/talk to a customer service person, I would recommend spending more and getting the top tier of treadmills. If you can't afford that, this is a good option - now that I've figured out this issue and know my console isn't broken, I am really happy with the value for money here. But I do worry about what happens if something breaks in future and customer service is unreachable, so save yourself the headache if that experience would ruin your day. For our next treadmill we're definitely going with a more deluxe, expensive option whose customer service we've vetted in advance.","Reviewed in the United States August 12, 2022",AHTBKZOR3WUPACKTITAHQ7A67VLQ,True,From the United States,,B0BMMC4NST,50.0

R8NE0W53BL93P,Apple Health/Apple Watch Review,C.H.,4,"Note: This review is for the Bluetooth Model that is only available directly from Lifespan.comI have had this treadmill for a month and have put over 500,000 steps on it. One of my main concerns was its integration with Apple Health (and Apple Watch). It mostly works but requires some tinkering and manual input. Read below for how to get credit for steps and distance in Apple Health (a one-time set up) and how to close your rings on the Apple Watch (manually entry required for each workout).Apple Health:For starters, when you are done with a walk, you can use the Bluetooth to sync the data from the console to your phone. If the Lifespan App doesn't prompt you upon setting up, you need to go to Settings --> Health --> Data Access & Devices --> Lifespan, then turn on access for Lifespan to write data.Next, open the Health App. Find ""Steps"" and scroll to the bottom to find ""Data Sources & Access."" First, make sure that Steps is allowed to read Lifespan data (it should be on already). Next, you'll need to prioritize the Lifespan App over other data sources. This will count the step recorded on the treadmill over the steps recorded by your phone/watch (if you are like me, your hands are at a keyboard and don't move much while walking so my watch doesn’t record many steps while I walk). To change the priority of the data sources, select ""Edit"" in the top right corner and move Lifespan about your phone and Apple watch. I have mine second below ""Health"" and above other sources like my phone and watch. This will now give you credit in Apple Health for the steps you took on the treadmill after you perform a Bluetooth sync. To confirm it works, after recording a walk and syncing in the Lifespan App, open the Health App, select “Steps,” then select ""Show All Data"" from the bottom of the Steps screen, select the day, and see the entry by the Lifespan app.Follow the same procedure for ""Steps"" above for ""Walking + Running Distance"" from the Health App (e.g., change the priority of the data sources). This will give you credit in Apple Health for the distance you walked.Apple Watch:The above will get your data into Apple Health on your phone, but not onto your Apple Watch. If the developers could update the Lifespan App to record your walk as a Workout Data Source (like Stava or Run Keeper do), rather than just as steps and distance data sources, that would solve all problems and this product/app would be a 5-star product. Unfortunately, this is not the case.To update your rings on your Apple Watch after you finish a walk, you need to open the Health App, select ""Workouts"" and then select ""Add Data"" in the top right corner. Here you need to manually enter the workout. For example, I change the Activity Type to ""Walking"" (it's classified as an outdoor walk, oh well), enter the Calories and Distance, and change the time to match your walk time. I recommend adding the activity or at least writing down your stats (e.g., time, calories, distance) before you sync over Bluetooth as syncing clears your console's stats (if this happens, you can get your stats from the Lifespan App).While you will see your workout listed on your Apple Watch in the Activity App (e.g., outdoor walk – x miles), it won't include the steps you took on the treadmill (but it does in the Apple Health app, which is what counts down the road anyway). However, the Activity App will update your Activity Ring and Move Ring based on the time and calories you entered. It can even give you standing credit retroactively if you exercised the whole hour.Hopefully, this review helps some of you who walk while you work and want to close your rings too. The solution is not perfect, but it's not too much of a hassle to enter your workout to make sure you get credit for it on your Apple Watch.","Reviewed in the United States May 8, 2020",AHRDMJ3QJ3UJWX76PCZ5CGIZOE6A,False,From the United States,,B0BMMC4NST,16.0

Admittedly I was a little skeptical about the reviews on noise level, but it certainly lives up to expectation on this front. It is quiet enough to not be heard in the next room.Special shout out to the seller.

I've had a couple of issues with my treadmill where a strange noise was coming from it (first I think was a belt issue and second was a motor issue or loose screw), and the company mailed me the replacement parts and scheduled for a technician to come by and fix it (both free of charge).The only thing I would change about this is the weight. It's really heavy and isn't meant to be moved around the house too often.

It is very weighted and constructed well for running on it and I feel very secure. I read so many reviews for treadmills and landed on this one for the addition of the incline, the small size, the multi-functionality of it being a walking pad, a all in one desk, and a classic running treadmill. It is also moveable with wheels for the times I need to get it out of the way.

R1I9Y3VYI2IAV3,Great with one minor issue,Sherri,4,"I've been using this treadmill for nearly a month, and it works great. I weigh 135 lbs. and use it for walking only. I can't speak to how it would hold up for a runner. I would recommend this treadmill, with a minor caveat. The tray is flimsy and forces me to stand back too close to the rear edge of the belt. The spot for a drink is just a small depression in the plastic, so the vibration of the treadmill causes drinks to topple over. My iPad shakes/moves and even if it were to stay put, I find it sits too close and I have to look down at it which isn't comfortable. Luckily I did not purchase it to use as a desk, so the unusable tray isn't a deal breaker for me.Before this purchase, I used a heavier-duty treadmill. So yes, this one compared to my prior machine, feels quite a bit different, not as sturdy. But, I expected that. I replaced the old machine because I wanted ease of storage and the bigger machine, even when folded, took up a huge amount of space. This treadmill folds flat and can be stood up flat against a wall. Other than the flimsy tray, the rest of the machine has a good-quality feel. Again, not as sturdy as a larger treadmill, but not cheap. It required no assembly and was ready to plug in and use straight out of the box.","Reviewed in the United States October 29, 2024",AGPOMXKTNK2LZNE5VYMCK2UKDA2A,True,From the United States,Color: Desk Workstation - Wristband Remote,B0CGLYKX93,24.0
R2CEV1B0X5CFLV,"Convenient storage, suitable for family",Chloe,5,"The treadmill was well packaged, most of the time from assembly to use was spent unpacking the box. It is a bit heavy and required two people to lift it out of the box, but it looks very sturdy and durable. The setup was super easy and the size was just right for a spare spot in my living room. It is quiet and I can watch TV without any interruptions. I appreciate the convenience of the watch remote control, which can easily adjust the speed and exercise mode. It has an incline, but it is not electrically operated, you need to manually lift the front wheel, which is not a problem for me. Considering the price, I think it is already a great value for money.

R2HSOV5VD6BR4D,Honestly exactly what I needed!,Amy C.,5,"Been really loving this treadmill so much especially with how convenient and easy it was to assemble and move it around the house. I try to hit my daily goal of steps and with the cold weather outside, it was really hard to even get myself out of the house but with this, I can easily get my 10k steps. Even more is that the incline is the perfect amount I need to get an intense workout while I can also choose many different HIIT programs included.

R1FOBLNAABYYQ9,Poor out of box experience and missing instructions.,Hayden,2,"This is a preliminary review of the product. I got the product yesterday and got it set up today to try it out.First things first, the over all build quality seems fine. Nothing came damaged right out of the box and everything appears to be present and intact.Now for the bad news and the reason for this review. My treadmill came completely unlubricated out of the box, dry as a bone. Despite the manual claiming that they come prelubricated from the factory. As a result the walking experience on the treadmill is terrible. I've tried to apply some of the included lubricant on both sides of the deck underneath the belt as instructed in the manual. I applied two lines on each side running the length of the treadmill and that didn't seem to have any effect at all on the scratchy, load, high friction experience I'm having trying to walk on the treadmill. At this rate it seems like I'm going to have to completely remove or massively loosen the belt so that I can reach further underneath it with the lubricant and use much much more of the provided lubricant to get a desired smoothness.There was also one other problem I'm having with the treadmill. It comes with two remotes but only one of them can be paired to the treadmill at a time. The problem is the remote I want to use is not the one that is pre-paired. Worse yet there are no instructions for how to pair it in the manual, that section seems to be completely missing from the instructions. (Note the pre-paired remote does include instructions for how to pair it to the treadmill)I've already reached out to the manufacturer for support about these topics and guidance on the lubrication process since it's much more involved than it should be. It's supposed to be fully functional out of the box and it appears like my unit just completely missed the factory lubrication step and as a result it's a very poor experience so far.I will update this review if and when I hear back from the manufacturer about my units problems. If I don't hear back within a reasonable amount of time I'm just going to return the unit and get a refund. I have a 30 day window to get this figured out before I miss my refund window.","Reviewed in the United States February 26, 2025",AHVPD73TNKXG3VRUCEP4F7IH66NA,True,From the United States,Color: Desk Workstation - Wristband Remote,B0CGLYKX93,1.0

I can't speak to how it would hold up for a runner. I would recommend this treadmill, with a minor caveat. The tray is flimsy and forces me to stand back too close to the rear edge of the belt. The spot for a drink is just a small depression in the plastic, so the vibration of the treadmill causes drinks to topple over. My iPad shakes/moves and even if it were to stay put, I find it sits too close and I have to look down at it which isn't comfortable. Luckily I did not purchase it to use as a desk, so the unusable tray isn't a deal breaker for me.Before this purchase, I used a heavier-duty treadmill. So yes, this one compared to my prior machine, feels quite a bit different, not as sturdy. But, I expected that. I replaced the old machine because I wanted ease of storage and the bigger machine, even when folded, took up a huge amount of space. This treadmill folds flat and can be stood up flat against a wall. Other than the flimsy tray, the rest of the machine has a good-quality feel. Again, not as sturdy as a larger treadmill, but not cheap.

R1LY06QQFHUIR3,Great customer service,Gidget,4,"I bought this walking pad in August 2024 and use it daily putting on between 3 and 10 miles. Most often I put on 6 miles a day. After 4 months the motor started making a ticking noise like the wheel of fortune wheel does. I contacted CS and let them know. They quickly responded and after reviewing the video snippet I sent them, they determined that a new motor would be best. They shipped me a new motor, guided me, via video, through the easy steps to replace it myself. I now have it back to like new condition. Fingers crossed this motor does not go out as fast, which is why this was not a 5 star. BTW, I am a women with no mechanical experience other than normal life brings about.

It’s not massively padded and I don’t want to burn the motor out. They do say to rest the treadmill for 10min after an hour of use.The only thing I wish I had was a higher desk when I’m on zoom calls but I just used a riser and it works fine.Also the remote didn’t work straight out of the box which is why it’s getting 4 starts instead of 5.","Reviewed in the United States January 16, 2025",AEF7DWFW7P36WQD6PRTBPRZCUNUA,True,From the United States,Color: Desk Workstation - Wristband Remote,B0CGLYKX93,4.0

Other than that, it works great! No set up out of the box other than a little oil under the pad. There’s a master power switch on the front which is nice if you have kids who like to play with remotes.

It easily fits under my desk, and when not in use, I can slide it under my bed or against the wall.- Smooth Walking & Jogging Experience – It’s great for casual walking while working, and it also allows for light jogging when I want to get a bit more exercise in.- Quiet Operation – One of my biggest concerns was noise, but this treadmill runs surprisingly quietly. It doesn’t disturb my meetings or calls.Cons- Speed Limitations – While it’s perfect for walking and light jogging, it’s not meant for running, as the speed maxes out at a moderate pace.- Remote Needs to Be Kept Handy – Since there are no built-in buttons, losing the remote could be inconvenient.Final Verdict:The Elseluck Walking Pad is an excellent option for those who want to stay active while working or watching TV.

It easily fits under my desk, and when not in use, I can slide it under my bed or against the wall.- Smooth Walking & Jogging Experience – It’s great for casual walking while working, and it also allows for light jogging when I want to get a bit more exercise in.- Quiet Operation – One of my biggest concerns was noise, but this treadmill runs surprisingly quietly. It doesn’t disturb my meetings or calls.Cons- Speed Limitations – While it’s perfect for walking and light jogging, it’s not meant for running, as the speed maxes out at a moderate pace.- Remote Needs to Be Kept Handy – Since there are no built-in buttons, losing the remote could be inconvenient.Final Verdict:The Elseluck Walking Pad is an excellent option for those who want to stay active while working or watching TV.

R3LS43A878HOPU,Way more than I expected for this price.,Brandon,5,"I needed a standing desk for home and I was a little apprehensive about buying this one due to the low price. Most of the standing desks I was looking at were in the 300 to 500 dollar range. I was shocked with what I got.Unboxing:The package was much smaller than I had expected it to be and I was a bit worried for a moment but read on for the explanation of the box size. There were a few dents and dings on the box that came from shipping and handling. I was certain that those dents and dings would also be on the contents. I opened the package to find thick white high quality foam. Not cheap styrofoam but the high quality type often used for packing computers and other high end electronics. There was a pocket for each item to keep things from crashing around in the box and hitting one another. Each part was individually wrapped in plastic. The desktop came in two pieces separated lengthwise and uses six dowels to join it together. The desktop looked in the pictures like some sort of distressed or antique wood so I was not sure what to expect when I received it but it is just a high quality printed veneer and I am perfectly happy with it. The dowels slipped right in and did not need to be hammered. The top is then held together by the various mounts and brackets that go underneath. I like the two piece desktop as it is the reason the box is so small. After assembly I found four heavy duty rubber corner pieces and actually spent a few minutes trying to find where they go before realizing that they were actually corner protectors for the desk top.Assembly: Total parts count was fairly low and the diagrams in the instructions were perfectly clear. I actually did not pay attention to any of the actual words as the diagrams left nothing to be questioned. The required tools were included however if you spent the money on the desk I recommend just a few dollars more to buy any cheap electric screwdriver as it is a huge time saver. There were no parts that seemed fiddly or places where I thought I needed a helper.

R3LS43A878HOPU,Way more than I expected for this price.,Brandon,5,"I needed a standing desk for home and I was a little apprehensive about buying this one due to the low price. Most of the standing desks I was looking at were in the 300 to 500 dollar range. I was shocked with what I got.Unboxing:The package was much smaller than I had expected it to be and I was a bit worried for a moment but read on for the explanation of the box size. There were a few dents and dings on the box that came from shipping and handling. I was certain that those dents and dings would also be on the contents. I opened the package to find thick white high quality foam. Not cheap styrofoam but the high quality type often used for packing computers and other high end electronics. There was a pocket for each item to keep things from crashing around in the box and hitting one another. Each part was individually wrapped in plastic. The desktop came in two pieces separated lengthwise and uses six dowels to join it together. The desktop looked in the pictures like some sort of distressed or antique wood so I was not sure what to expect when I received it but it is just a high quality printed veneer and I am perfectly happy with it. The dowels slipped right in and did not need to be hammered. The top is then held together by the various mounts and brackets that go underneath. I like the two piece desktop as it is the reason the box is so small. After assembly I found four heavy duty rubber corner pieces and actually spent a few minutes trying to find where they go before realizing that they were actually corner protectors for the desk top.Assembly: Total parts count was fairly low and the diagrams in the instructions were perfectly clear. I actually did not pay attention to any of the actual words as the diagrams left nothing to be questioned. The required tools were included however if you spent the money on the desk I recommend just a few dollars more to buy any cheap electric screwdriver as it is a huge time saver. There were no parts that seemed fiddly or places where I thought I needed a helper. The instructions showed to flip the desk upside down to screw on the desktop but a trick I found helpful was to temporarily power up the control panel and raise the desk to it's maximum height. Then place the desktop on and just sit underneath to screw things together.Function:As mentioned before I did not bother with anything other than the assembly diagrams. Even the control panel was very self explanatory. Setting the presets is just like in a stereo, you just press and hold to store that height. The desk does move very quickly but it is fast enough to be used regularly throughout the day. The motor is fairly quiet and the desk moves smoothly with no grinding sounds. The top is a tad thin so there is some flex to it when my arms are resting on it but I do have fairly large arms.Conclusion:Far more value for the money than expected. I would buy other products made by this company based on the quality. Assembly is fast and easy and package is fairly small albeit a bit heavy. It seems to work well and I have found nothing deceptive with the way that this desk was advertised. I did just finish the setup so I will update this in the future if I have issues. I am good about updating reviews if a product fails after the fact so if you don't see an update then everything is still as described.","Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2024",AHLTG6TBHL5EBPCA5PCDIKQ46YIQ,True,From the United States,"Color: Rustic Brown, Size: 48",B0BZ7GXM4M,219.0
R1N61EXZNVJDZ7,Sturdy Desk at a Great Price,Joel W,5,"I just finished assembling this desk, and I'm pleased with its quality so far. I bought it somewhat on impulse while browsing for computer desks because Amazon had a great coupon deal on it and it fell within the size I needed. After assembly, I realize it is well worth the full price.Pros:- The legs are very sturdy, made of hefty metal tubing. They add a lot of weight, helping with stability. Plenty of bolts are used to keep all the parts tight and wobble-free. The feet bars are as long as the desk is deep, and the feet are independently adjustable for leveling. Even at max height, this desk feels stable and would be difficult to accidentally tip over.- The desk itself is made of 2 fiberboard panels, split long-wise, with a texturized plastic veneer (which probably helps prevent scratching). The imitation woodgrain looks very realistic.- The cable holders built into the back of the desk are very convenient.- There is a J-hook tucked under the left and right side of the desk to hang headphones or other items. They spin freely in mounts, so you can rotate them 360 degrees. I wouldn't put anything heavy on them, but they are convenient.- The height controls are very simple to use: just hold a button to raise or lower the desk. You can store the current height setting in 1 of 3 memory slots, and just press a single button to adjust to one of the stored heights. It has a child safety lock-out feature to prevent unwanted use of the height adjustment controls.- The desk is large enough to hold my 19"" laptop on a cooler, full-size keyboard, and over-sized mousepad with plenty of room to spare. You could easily squeeze a normal desktop setup on the desk, or put the tower off the desk and run a triple-monitor setup.Cons (all minor):- The power cord is rather short for my use (desk in the middle of a room), but would likely be sufficient for most users who put the desk near a wall like a logical person would.- The cable organizers are made of a hollow plastic that is rather flimsy and could break easily if a cable gets yanked in the wrong direction.- The screw holes in the desk panels (used to attach the desk to the legs) are just drilled into the fiberboard. An inset metal nut may have been a better design. The fiberboard desk panels felt a bit soft when I was driving the screws in, so I set my drill at 4/10 torque to prevent stripping and everything came out nice and sturdy.- One of the fiberboard panels came out of the box with a noticeable bow, creating a dip of at least 1/2 inch in the middle of the panel. This was entirely negated once the desk was fully assembled, so this was only a momentary cause for concern in my case. If the second panel had the same bow, it would still exist once the panels are connected.Overall, I see myself using this desk for years to come. I would definitely recommend it.","Reviewed in the United States February 21, 2025",AE4CED7RILGC7GMUASS24HSHKF5Q,True,From the United States,"Color: Rustic Brown, Size: 48",B0BZ7GXM4M,11.0

This means leaning on my desk or even resting my hands while typing puts pressure on the desk and I'm worried that this will continue to put strain on an ever growing seam.

It came with a faulty controller that did not respond to any button presses or power on. I use the multimeter to confirm that there was electricity making it to the controller in the controller was defective. I then contacted support telling them that I needed a new controller unit for the desk and they made me wait approximately one week to receive an entirely new desk so I could simply pull the controller unit out of the new desk and place it on my already assemble desk once the replacement desk arrived. I did so in upon insulation I confirmed that the motor on my original desk was mounted incorrectly, and the desk would only Operate in reverse order and would never fully come back down to the lowest setting. Support did not present any resolutions and I now have two incomplete non-functioning units.","Reviewed in the United States February 27, 2025",AH6MX6NCD4LAPI775PLEJPXD3XBA,True,From the United States,"Color: Rustic Brown, Size: 48",B0BZ7GXM4M,3.0

R3LS43A878HOPU,Way more than I expected for this price.,Brandon,5,"I needed a standing desk for home and I was a little apprehensive about buying this one due to the low price. Most of the standing desks I was looking at were in the 300 to 500 dollar range. I was shocked with what I got.Unboxing:The package was much smaller than I had expected it to be and I was a bit worried for a moment but read on for the explanation of the box size. There were a few dents and dings on the box that came from shipping and handling. I was certain that those dents and dings would also be on the contents. I opened the package to find thick white high quality foam. Not cheap styrofoam but the high quality type often used for packing computers and other high end electronics. There was a pocket for each item to keep things from crashing around in the box and hitting one another. Each part was individually wrapped in plastic. The desktop came in two pieces separated lengthwise and uses six dowels to join it together. The desktop looked in the pictures like some sort of distressed or antique wood so I was not sure what to expect when I received it but it is just a high quality printed veneer and I am perfectly happy with it. The dowels slipped right in and did not need to be hammered. The top is then held together by the various mounts and brackets that go underneath. I like the two piece desktop as it is the reason the box is so small. After assembly I found four heavy duty rubber corner pieces and actually spent a few minutes trying to find where they go before realizing that they were actually corner protectors for the desk top.Assembly: Total parts count was fairly low and the diagrams in the instructions were perfectly clear. I actually did not pay attention to any of the actual words as the diagrams left nothing to be questioned. The required tools were included however if you spent the money on the desk I recommend just a few dollars more to buy any cheap electric screwdriver as it is a huge time saver. There were no parts that seemed fiddly or places where I thought I needed a helper. The instructions showed to flip the desk upside down to screw on the desktop but a trick I found helpful was to temporarily power up the control panel and raise the desk to it's maximum height. Then place the desktop on and just sit underneath to screw things together.Function:As mentioned before I did not bother with anything other than the assembly diagrams. Even the control panel was very self explanatory. Setting the presets is just like in a stereo, you just press and hold to store that height. The desk does move very quickly but it is fast enough to be used regularly throughout the day. The motor is fairly quiet and the desk moves smoothly with no grinding sounds. The top is a tad thin so there is some flex to it when my arms are resting on it but I do have fairly large arms.Conclusion:Far more value for the money than expected. I would buy other products made by this company based on the quality. Assembly is fast and easy and package is fairly small albeit a bit heavy. It seems to work well and I have found nothing deceptive with the way that this desk was advertised. I did just finish the setup so I will update this in the future if I have issues. I am good about updating reviews if a product fails after the fact so if you don't see an update then everything is still as described.","Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2024",AHLTG6TBHL5EBPCA5PCDIKQ46YIQ,True,From the United States,"Color: Rustic Brown, Size: 48",B0BZ7GXM4M,219.0
R1N61EXZNVJDZ7,Sturdy Desk at a Great Price,Joel W,5,"I just finished assembling this desk, and I'm pleased with its quality so far. I bought it somewhat on impulse while browsing for computer desks because Amazon had a great coupon deal on it and it fell within the size I needed. After assembly, I realize it is well worth the full price.Pros:- The legs are very sturdy, made of hefty metal tubing. They add a lot of weight, helping with stability. Plenty of bolts are used to keep all the parts tight and wobble-free. The feet bars are as long as the desk is deep, and the feet are independently adjustable for leveling. Even at max height, this desk feels stable and would be difficult to accidentally tip over.- The desk itself is made of 2 fiberboard panels, split long-wise, with a texturized plastic veneer (which probably helps prevent scratching). The imitation woodgrain looks very realistic.- The cable holders built into the back of the desk are very convenient.- There is a J-hook tucked under the left and right side of the desk to hang headphones or other items. They spin freely in mounts, so you can rotate them 360 degrees. I wouldn't put anything heavy on them, but they are convenient.- The height controls are very simple to use: just hold a button to raise or lower the desk. You can store the current height setting in 1 of 3 memory slots, and just press a single button to adjust to one of the stored heights. It has a child safety lock-out feature to prevent unwanted use of the height adjustment controls.- The desk is large enough to hold my 19"" laptop on a cooler, full-size keyboard, and over-sized mousepad with plenty of room to spare. You could easily squeeze a normal desktop setup on the desk, or put the tower off the desk and run a triple-monitor setup.Cons (all minor):- The power cord is rather short for my use (desk in the middle of a room), but would likely be sufficient for most users who put the desk near a wall like a logical person would.- The cable organizers are made of a hollow plastic that is rather flimsy and could break easily if a cable gets yanked in the wrong direction.- The screw holes in the desk panels (used to attach the desk to the legs) are just drilled into the fiberboard. An inset metal nut may have been a better design. The fiberboard desk panels felt a bit soft when I was driving the screws in, so I set my drill at 4/10 torque to prevent stripping and everything came out nice and sturdy.- One of the fiberboard panels came out of the box with a noticeable bow, creating a dip of at least 1/2 inch in the middle of the panel. This was entirely negated once the desk was fully assembled, so this was only a momentary cause for concern in my case. If the second panel had the same bow, it would still exist once the panels are connected.Overall, I see myself using this desk for years to come.

R2OP7KSL5T1R29,Game Changer for your home office!!,Julia,5,"I’m absolutely in love with my new ErGear Adjustable Electric Standing Desk! It has completely transformed the way I work from home. I was initially hesitant about switching from a traditional desk to a sit-stand model, but this desk has proven to be one of the best investments I’ve made for my productivity and health.First off, the build quality is excellent. The desk surface is smooth and spacious at 63 x 28 inches, giving me plenty of room for my computer, monitor, keyboard, and even a few extra items without feeling cramped. It’s also very sturdy, even when fully extended to its highest setting, so I never worry about wobbling or instability.The electric height adjustment is incredibly smooth and fast. With just the push of a button, I can easily transition between sitting and standing, and it has multiple preset height options that I can program to suit my preferred positions. This feature has been a huge plus, as it allows me to switch positions throughout the day without interrupting my workflow. I find that alternating between sitting and standing has helped with my posture and overall comfort.The desk is also quiet when raising and lowering, which is a nice touch. I can make adjustments without disturbing my meetings or making unnecessary noise. The assembly was straightforward, and all the tools were included in the package—took me about 30 minutes to put it together.I also love the cable management system that helps keep cords organized and out of sight, which keeps my workspace looking clean and tidy.Overall, I highly recommend this ErGear Adjustable Electric Standing Desk to anyone looking to upgrade their home office. Whether you’re working from home full-time or just need a desk that offers flexibility and comfort, this desk will definitely meet your needs. It’s made a huge difference in my daily routine and has helped me stay more productive and energized.

R1913IEP55CA4S,"So far, so good. I'll update if anything changes.",Raaaatchel,4,"I did a lot of research before picking this one, but it is still a bargain standing desk despite being the most expensive one I was looking at, so keep that in mind.That being said, the top of this one is two separate pieces, but they are connected at multiple points by different pieces of hardware, so it feels very sturdy and doesn't make me too nervous about the two sides starting to sag over time like I saw on reviews of similar desks.You can see in the picture that the bulk of my stuff is on the back piece of the desk top, so we'll see if that causes any issues over time. The top is supposedly rated for 176 pounds, and my stuff is very far under that, so theoretically I should be OK.The motor has been working fine since I plugged it in with no issues, though it does have a very faint consistent humming at the plug. As long as there is any amount of other sound in the vicinity of it I don't hear it, but this may be an issue for others.Putting it together was very straightforward and quick, and I was able to do it by myself. I am loving the ability to set different heights, and being able to bring up the height from a normal desk height even while I'm sitting is already helping me sit up straighter and put less strain on my neck, back, and shoulders.So far, I recommend this for anyone who's looking for a solid standing desk at a reasonable price.

Instructions clear enough and straight forward; 20-30mins or so.Quality - A bit let down but still satisfied. Be very light handed with assembly. Not much torque at all. The hardware and design make it easy to figure out. I just don’t trust it’ll last more than a couple years but who knows? This is aOperation is smooth and quiet, maybe the motor quality is where the extra $80 vs other brands is going?Overall I’d still recommend the desk, but if you’re on a tight budget look elsewhere tbh.","Reviewed in the United States April 6, 2025",AH3TR2VOXPYBITHJEZCJEBIPKNFA,True,From the United States,"Size: 55*28 Inch, Color: Black",B0B41YH9B6,

R2OP7KSL5T1R29,Game Changer for your home office!!,Julia,5,"I’m absolutely in love with my new ErGear Adjustable Electric Standing Desk! It has completely transformed the way I work from home. I was initially hesitant about switching from a traditional desk to a sit-stand model, but this desk has proven to be one of the best investments I’ve made for my productivity and health.First off, the build quality is excellent. The desk surface is smooth and spacious at 63 x 28 inches, giving me plenty of room for my computer, monitor, keyboard, and even a few extra items without feeling cramped. It’s also very sturdy, even when fully extended to its highest setting, so I never worry about wobbling or instability.The electric height adjustment is incredibly smooth and fast. With just the push of a button, I can easily transition between sitting and standing, and it has multiple preset height options that I can program to suit my preferred positions. This feature has been a huge plus, as it allows me to switch positions throughout the day without interrupting my workflow. I find that alternating between sitting and standing has helped with my posture and overall comfort.The desk is also quiet when raising and lowering, which is a nice touch. I can make adjustments without disturbing my meetings or making unnecessary noise. The assembly was straightforward, and all the tools were included in the package—took me about 30 minutes to put it together.I also love the cable management system that helps keep cords organized and out of sight, which keeps my workspace looking clean and tidy.Overall, I highly recommend this ErGear Adjustable Electric Standing Desk to anyone looking to upgrade their home office. Whether you’re working from home full-time or just need a desk that offers flexibility and comfort, this desk will definitely meet your needs.

R1913IEP55CA4S,"So far, so good. I'll update if anything changes.",Raaaatchel,4,"I did a lot of research before picking this one, but it is still a bargain standing desk despite being the most expensive one I was looking at, so keep that in mind.That being said, the top of this one is two separate pieces, but they are connected at multiple points by different pieces of hardware, so it feels very sturdy and doesn't make me too nervous about the two sides starting to sag over time like I saw on reviews of similar desks.You can see in the picture that the bulk of my stuff is on the back piece of the desk top, so we'll see if that causes any issues over time. The top is supposedly rated for 176 pounds, and my stuff is very far under that, so theoretically I should be OK.The motor has been working fine since I plugged it in with no issues, though it does have a very faint consistent humming at the plug. As long as there is any amount of other sound in the vicinity of it I don't hear it, but this may be an issue for others.Putting it together was very straightforward and quick, and I was able to do it by myself. I am loving the ability to set different heights, and being able to bring up the height from a normal desk height even while I'm sitting is already helping me sit up straighter and put less strain on my neck, back, and shoulders.So far, I recommend this for anyone who's looking for a solid standing desk at a reasonable price. I will update if anything happens to increase/decrease my rating.","Reviewed in the United States February 26, 2025",AFJ4AF3WOUSLX3KWABLXABPISP2Q,True,From the United States,"Size: 40*24 Inch, Color: White",B0B41YH9B6,23.0

R2OP7KSL5T1R29,Game Changer for your home office!!,Julia,5,"I’m absolutely in love with my new ErGear Adjustable Electric Standing Desk! It has completely transformed the way I work from home. I was initially hesitant about switching from a traditional desk to a sit-stand model, but this desk has proven to be one of the best investments I’ve made for my productivity and health.First off, the build quality is excellent. The desk surface is smooth and spacious at 63 x 28 inches, giving me plenty of room for my computer, monitor, keyboard, and even a few extra items without feeling cramped. It’s also very sturdy, even when fully extended to its highest setting, so I never worry about wobbling or instability.The electric height adjustment is incredibly smooth and fast. With just the push of a button, I can easily transition between sitting and standing, and it has multiple preset height options that I can program to suit my preferred positions. This feature has been a huge plus, as it allows me to switch positions throughout the day without interrupting my workflow. I find that alternating between sitting and standing has helped with my posture and overall comfort.The desk is also quiet when raising and lowering, which is a nice touch. I can make adjustments without disturbing my meetings or making unnecessary noise. The assembly was straightforward, and all the tools were included in the package—took me about 30 minutes to put it together.I also love the cable management system that helps keep cords organized and out of sight, which keeps my workspace looking clean and tidy.Overall, I highly recommend this ErGear Adjustable Electric Standing Desk to anyone looking to upgrade their home office.

This desk has truly impressed me with its quality and functionality.First and foremost, the desk has a great weight to it, which adds to its stability and overall sturdiness. It doesn't feel or look cheap at all; on the contrary, it has a premium finish that complements my workspace beautifully. The motor on the desk raiser is a standout feature—quiet and smooth, it adjusts the desk height effortlessly.The assembly process was straightforward and hassle-free. It took me about 45 minutes to put everything together, and the instructions were clear and easy to follow. The picture drawings for placement were particularly helpful, making the entire setup process smooth and efficient.Overall, the Vivo Standing Desk is a fantastic addition to any workspace. It combines style, quality, and functionality in one sleek package.

Our favorite Brown Truck people managed to gouge a hole along the edge of the desktop. After contacting VIVO customer service and providing photos they offered a discount. I declined, and they promptly shipped a replacement desktop.It was easy enough to build, but the directions are lacking on how to set the correct width on the legs for the size desktop you have. The electronics include a digital readout of the height setting so you have a reliable way to get it exactly where you had it before, plus buttons for multiple pre-set heights.I'm very pleased with the overall quality and have experienced no lean or wobble (and there are adjustable feet on all four corners should I ever need to adjust).

RN2YQMWA5E7UA,Great work surface!,Tracy or Andrew,5,"*Husband review*Sent this to Seller on JAN-26-2024:""Sharp edges observed at leading edge of panel joining. Recommendations for safety & level:(1) Full-length joining channel at front & rear instead of four short channels. Middle panel least support - continuous passive/active downward load with resting hands on keyboard.(2) Thicker gauge screws for joining channels, need better grab per above.Otherwise.. very nice, very quiet desk, good price.""Assembly was fairly easy. The only challenging aspect was setting the leg width AND drive rod simultaneously. Otherwise, you should have this together within 2 hours, max: 30-45 minutes for the frame, and the rest of the time putting the top together, placing it on the frame, and situating the desk. A cordless drill with a low speed/high torque and torque adjustment dial will make this even easier. You just need one #2 Phillips and one Allen wrench bits to get this done. No hammers or other tools needed. They made it very simple especially with having the motor already mounted. Great instructions, too.The height adjustment is surprisingly quiet and VERY smooth. You have four programmable pre-set buttons with a manual UP and DOWN button. The lowest possible setting with the provided casters is a typical sitting desk or dining table height. So, depending on how you prefer to elevate your hands/arms for typing and using your mouse, you might consider an undermount keyboard/mouse thingy. It feels like the desk can be manually increased/decreased by 1/8"" increments -- you really should have no issue finding the right height for you.The frame has substantial enough weight to keep the top from feeling the slightest wobble. This was my biggest issue with my prior desk -- if I bumped it during a video call, it would wobble and look like I was having an earthquake.And the top is substantial enough to mount reasonably weighted items underneath. Not just baskets and tracks to hold cords and surge protectors, but PC mounts if, again, it's reasonable. Make sure your screw length won't penetrate the top surface. For what you set on top the desktop surface, follow the manufacturer's limits for combined weight.The frame box includes two of these cord holders. When mounted, they're out of sight - out of mind, so.. I don't have a use for them, yet! But I suppose they could hold headphones or a corded earbud/IEM. Maybe a few cords, dunno.I got the 32""Wx63""L unit. In hindsight, I might have gotten the longer desk (73"" I think) because my old desk was sort of L-shaped, but I'm using less equipment now that I have a KVM switch for my 2-PC / 2-monitor set-up. So I should be good to go.UNRELATED TO THE DESK ITSELF BUT CRITICAL TO KEEP IN MIND.. Just be very clear AND CAREFUL when setting up your cable management, accessories, and living beings stored/visiting under ANY sit-stand desk:- My PC is on a standalone cart just inches from the floor, under my desk to mitigate sound/vibration issues. I had to ensure my HDMI, DisplayPort and USB-3.0 cables (A) were long enough at the DESK'S MAX HEIGHT position AND MONITOR PLACEMENT and (B) didn't cause a trip hazard since there's a walking path along the backside of my desk. Be mindful of the absolute max-height needed where all your connections occur. The last thing you want is to proudly sit at your new desk, press the button for max height, hark! the herald desk rises to glory, annnnnnd your monitors (assuming on stands and not mounted on arms) get ever so slightly tilted then violently pulled back only to plummet to their demise.- I have two large speakers and my PC tower/cart under my desk. I had to make sure at the lowest possible position, the motor would not crush/break or otherwise come in contact with the top of those items. Luckily, the speakers are ~3"" away from the bottom of the motor, and the PC is set on the outside, between one of the legs and the wall. If you keep a filing cabinet or some other accessory under the desk, be aware of all elements under the desk's structural components during set-up.- Goes without saying.. Watch for small children and pets when raising and lowering the desk. When the desk achieves the lowest point, there are likely pinch points at the base of each leg.","Reviewed in the United States January 16, 2024",AEKWUQ2UQ6MDM6FES73JZNPQ7CJA,True,From the United States,"Size: 63 x 32-inch, Color: Carbon Fiber Top / Black Frame",B07V6ZSHF4,84.0

R73OEAM8NQA9P,Great Addition for a Home Office,John_JT,5,"We purchased the VIVO Electric 60 x 30 inch Standing Desk Workstation along with the 18-inch Under Desk Lockable Slide Out Drawer, and the Dual Monitor Desk Mount. We figured that if we bought everything from the same manufacturer, it would all just work together better than mixing and matching. We are very pleased with the quality of all of the products. The workstation is heavy, well-designed and pretty easy to put together. We thought that with the table length of 60-inches we would be able to mount two of the slide out drawers underneath and bought two. That didn’t work, due to interference by the strong connection brackets for the tabletop, so we had to return one of them. The instruction manual could have bigger print; it was a little hard to red. Also, there are several different sized connectors and a full-size illustration of each screw size would make it easier to tell them apart.The slide out drawer is strong and easy to install. If you order a workstation with a tabletop that comes in two pieces, you might not be able to mount it because of the solid drawer frame top.The dual monitor desk mount is another strong item. We are using it with the clamp-on mount instead of drilling a hole through the workstation table.

R1WEUISR2UG4KQ,Awesome Desk - Great price and looks great...seriously!,Erik,5,"I recently purchased the Vivo Standing Desk (43"" in white/white), and I couldn't be more pleased with my choice. This desk has truly impressed me with its quality and functionality.First and foremost, the desk has a great weight to it, which adds to its stability and overall sturdiness. It doesn't feel or look cheap at all; on the contrary, it has a premium finish that complements my workspace beautifully. The motor on the desk raiser is a standout feature—quiet and smooth, it adjusts the desk height effortlessly.The assembly process was straightforward and hassle-free. It took me about 45 minutes to put everything together, and the instructions were clear and easy to follow. The picture drawings for placement were particularly helpful, making the entire setup process smooth and efficient.Overall, the Vivo Standing Desk is a fantastic addition to any workspace. It combines style, quality, and functionality in one sleek package. Highly recommended for anyone looking to upgrade their desk setup!I did also accidently order 2 desks (by mistake i.e. added to my cart too many times); their customer support were very friendly, professional, and helpful and assist me quickly with how best to return.

R3GH4V219STGS9,"Great desk, great value, great customer service",Turpenstein,5,"I bought the 60"" x 24"" model (not a freebie, no special promotions -- I'm just a guy that needed an adjustable desk).My desk arrived in two boxes: the desktop in one and hardware in the other. Our favorite Brown Truck people managed to gouge a hole along the edge of the desktop. After contacting VIVO customer service and providing photos they offered a discount. I declined, and they promptly shipped a replacement desktop.It was easy enough to build, but the directions are lacking on how to set the correct width on the legs for the size desktop you have. The electronics include a digital readout of the height setting so you have a reliable way to get it exactly where you had it before, plus buttons for multiple pre-set heights.I'm very pleased with the overall quality and have experienced no lean or wobble (and there are adjustable feet on all four corners should I ever need to adjust). I'm 5'9"" tall and the desk will elevate to a higher position than I'd ever need. I'm happy enough with the purchase that I'm ordering a VIVO PC mount for under the desk.","Reviewed in the United States January 22, 2025",AHSTNHORFEERLI25WD54MZ3LOSZA,True,From the United States,"Size: 60 x 24-inch, Color: Black Top / Black Frame",B07V6ZSHF4,13.0
RN2YQMWA5E7UA,Great work surface!,Tracy or Andrew,5,"*Husband review*Sent this to Seller on JAN-26-2024:""Sharp edges observed at leading edge of panel joining. Recommendations for safety & level:(1) Full-length joining channel at front & rear instead of four short channels. Middle panel least support - continuous passive/active downward load with resting hands on keyboard.(2) Thicker gauge screws for joining channels, need better grab per above.Otherwise.. very nice, very quiet desk, good price.""Assembly was fairly easy. The only challenging aspect was setting the leg width AND drive rod simultaneously. Otherwise, you should have this together within 2 hours, max: 30-45 minutes for the frame, and the rest of the time putting the top together, placing it on the frame, and situating the desk. A cordless drill with a low speed/high torque and torque adjustment dial will make this even easier. You just need one #2 Phillips and one Allen wrench bits to get this done. No hammers or other tools needed. They made it very simple especially with having the motor already mounted. Great instructions, too.The height adjustment is surprisingly quiet and VERY smooth. You have four programmable pre-set buttons with a manual UP and DOWN button. The lowest possible setting with the provided casters is a typical sitting desk or dining table height. So, depending on how you prefer to elevate your hands/arms for typing and using your mouse, you might consider an undermount keyboard/mouse thingy. It feels like the desk can be manually increased/decreased by 1/8"" increments -- you really should have no issue finding the right height for you.The frame has substantial enough weight to keep the top from feeling the slightest wobble. This was my biggest issue with my prior desk -- if I bumped it during a video call, it would wobble and look like I was having an earthquake.And the top is substantial enough to mount reasonably weighted items underneath. Not just baskets and tracks to hold cords and surge protectors, but PC mounts if, again, it's reasonable. Make sure your screw length won't penetrate the top surface. For what you set on top the desktop surface, follow the manufacturer's limits for combined weight.The frame box includes two of these cord holders. When mounted, they're out of sight - out of mind, so.. I don't have a use for them, yet! But I suppose they could hold headphones or a corded earbud/IEM. Maybe a few cords, dunno.I got the 32""Wx63""L unit. In hindsight, I might have gotten the longer desk (73"" I think) because my old desk was sort of L-shaped, but I'm using less equipment now that I have a KVM switch for my 2-PC / 2-monitor set-up. So I should be good to go.UNRELATED TO THE DESK ITSELF BUT CRITICAL TO KEEP IN MIND.. Just be very clear AND CAREFUL when setting up your cable management, accessories, and living beings stored/visiting under ANY sit-stand desk:- My PC is on a standalone cart just inches from the floor, under my desk to mitigate sound/vibration issues. I had to ensure my HDMI, DisplayPort and USB-3.0 cables (A) were long enough at the DESK'S MAX HEIGHT position AND MONITOR PLACEMENT and (B) didn't cause a trip hazard since there's a walking path along the backside of my desk. Be mindful of the absolute max-height needed where all your connections occur. The last thing you want is to proudly sit at your new desk, press the button for max height, hark! the herald desk rises to glory, annnnnnd your monitors (assuming on stands and not mounted on arms) get ever so slightly tilted then violently pulled back only to plummet to their demise.- I have two large speakers and my PC tower/cart under my desk. I had to make sure at the lowest possible position, the motor would not crush/break or otherwise come in contact with the top of those items. Luckily, the speakers are ~3"" away from the bottom of the motor, and the PC is set on the outside, between one of the legs and the wall. If you keep a filing cabinet or some other accessory under the desk, be aware of all elements under the desk's structural components during set-up.- Goes without saying.. Watch for small children and pets when raising and lowering the desk. When the desk achieves the lowest point, there are likely pinch points at the base of each leg.","Reviewed in the United States January 16, 2024",AEKWUQ2UQ6MDM6FES73JZNPQ7CJA,True,From the United States,"Size: 63 x 32-inch, Color: Carbon Fiber Top / Black Frame",B07V6ZSHF4,84.0

R2ECLJIQN43X6Q,Wobbly desk,Nick,2,"* Dropping my review to 2 stars. After making several attempts to make it less wobbly and failing at each, I think this is just down to a poor design. Where the 3 pieces connect making the desktop, it has started making a clicking sound when my arm moves across it. No matter how hard I press the boards together, still clicks.The desk is wobbly. I really dislike wobbly desks. I put it together properly and it's on hard floor. The front of the desk, where you sit, is where it gets wobbly. Any sort of movement makes the screen wobble (to reiterate: it's put together properly).The real measurement is also 29"" deep, not 30"" as advertised, which is odd.After assembling it, there is no point in returning it. If it was a brick and mortar store I'd definitely throw it in my truck and return it fully assembled. So, I suppose I'm stuck with it for a while.On a positive note, it does look good and it's fairly level where the desk top pieces fit together, which I was worried about. If this desk didn't wobble I'd bump it to four stars.Maybe I'll figure out how to lessen the wobble but other than vertical braces on the front of the desk going to the floor, I don't see any other way. If I did that, once I raise the desk the braces would rise off the floor.","Reviewed in the United States February 25, 2025",AGDIZYMMFXVKQYGQTI3MHVCBUTHQ,True,From the United States,"Size: 71 x 30-inch, Color: Vintage Brown Top / Black Frame",B07V6ZSHF4,1.0

Putnam,3,"Cons:- the top of the desk for the 71”x36” is three pieces, but they don’t sit flush and keep pulling apart about 1/16”-1/8”- the way the legs are constructed, there’s a small bit of sag in the middle- the middle section of the top of the desk does not have pre-drilled holes (see attached), so you have to construct the frame, then attach the legs to the desktop, then drill where the middle supports line up. Kind of annoying- the holes on the left side of the desk for the height adjustment buttons are drilled crooked (see attached), so the only options are to mount to the right side or drill your own holes- lay out the entire desktop and frame before beginning construction. I had to unscrew some of the screws attaching the frame to the desktop because the pre-drilled holes were drilled crooked and I could only use one side to attach the buttons.- if you aren’t happy with this product, you will have to pay to return it. It was only about $25, but be mindful that they won’t send you the prepaid shipping label until you call and then they’ll deduct it from the return amount- limited size options for the 30” depth desk.

Attached the other leg to the desk top.6. Moved the Inner Crossbar to middle of Crossbars and screwed it into place (There are no holes to line up for this).Lastly, the Sync Rod you have to insert between the two bases can easily be inserted after everything else is assembled and probably should be.Now for the review...I bought this a week ago and then of course it went on sale...go figure.Anyways I had been looking at a cheaper desk, about 75$ or so. I was reading reviews and read one indicating this desk was one piece. Well that is what I wanted and I failed to see they had purchased like the 60"" version, which does come in one piece.

Well, of course I recieved a three piece desk top with two large lines.Nothing wrong with desk - works fine, but had I been paying close attention, I would have opted for the cheaper desk as I can't really see what makes this desk worth $75 more.

R3HGRZ3AQFJ9Y,This is a great desk,Wood Mama,5,"Very sturdy desk, good materials, and fairly quick to put together. The only thing I didn't like was one step in the instructions where it talks about installing the center bar for the desk. It says to install this bar at whatever desired length, but what they don't tell you is when you go to put on the wood top of the desk it only has pre drilled holes for whatever their default length is. Once I got to this step I loosened the middle bar and adjusted accordingly.But yes, otherwise I have zero complaints. This is an awesome desk and I love that the top of this desk is one solid piece (all other options I saw were two pieces, having a crease down the middle).Make sure you consider the idea of getting longer cords or cord extensions. I had to order some in order to get to the max height for the desk.","Reviewed in the United States January 26, 2025",AF6FLDWAYEIJ7RTQBMWRTG74UWVA,True,From the United States,"Size: 60 x 24-inch, Color: Light Wood Top / White Frame",B07V6ZSHF4,5.0

Never had a single problem with the motors and it’s actually scratch free lol. My advice would be to get the 60x30 instead of the 60x24. The length actually matters and will give you more room!

It works just fine in terms of raising and lowering it.Unfortunately it is so incredibly unsturdy that with the monitor stand (same brand VIVO), that if I just touch it, it starts bending back and forth. I have tried to lean it against the wall, putting wood pieces underneath and tightening all the screws, but it just won't not move ALL the damn time.When I contacted customer service, I was told that there's nothing I can do and I could just buy the table that's 4x the price. My setup is well within the weight limits, so this should not be an issue by any means. I have even tried buying another desk shelf to put more weight on the backend, but this desk just will not stop moving around.So essentially it just does not fulfill the weight limitations stated.

R1WEUISR2UG4KQ,Awesome Desk - Great price and looks great...seriously!,Erik,5,"I recently purchased the Vivo Standing Desk (43"" in white/white), and I couldn't be more pleased with my choice. This desk has truly impressed me with its quality and functionality.First and foremost, the desk has a great weight to it, which adds to its stability and overall sturdiness. It doesn't feel or look cheap at all; on the contrary, it has a premium finish that complements my workspace beautifully. The motor on the desk raiser is a standout feature—quiet and smooth, it adjusts the desk height effortlessly.The assembly process was straightforward and hassle-free. It took me about 45 minutes to put everything together, and the instructions were clear and easy to follow. The picture drawings for placement were particularly helpful, making the entire setup process smooth and efficient.Overall, the Vivo Standing Desk is a fantastic addition to any workspace. It combines style, quality, and functionality in one sleek package. Highly recommended for anyone looking to upgrade their desk setup!I did also accidently order 2 desks (by mistake i.e. added to my cart too many times); their customer support were very friendly, professional, and helpful and assist me quickly with how best to return.

RN2YQMWA5E7UA,Great work surface!,Tracy or Andrew,5,"*Husband review*Sent this to Seller on JAN-26-2024:""Sharp edges observed at leading edge of panel joining. Recommendations for safety & level:(1) Full-length joining channel at front & rear instead of four short channels. Middle panel least support - continuous passive/active downward load with resting hands on keyboard.(2) Thicker gauge screws for joining channels, need better grab per above.Otherwise.. very nice, very quiet desk, good price.""Assembly was fairly easy. The only challenging aspect was setting the leg width AND drive rod simultaneously. Otherwise, you should have this together within 2 hours, max: 30-45 minutes for the frame, and the rest of the time putting the top together, placing it on the frame, and situating the desk. A cordless drill with a low speed/high torque and torque adjustment dial will make this even easier. You just need one #2 Phillips and one Allen wrench bits to get this done. No hammers or other tools needed. They made it very simple especially with having the motor already mounted. Great instructions, too.The height adjustment is surprisingly quiet and VERY smooth. You have four programmable pre-set buttons with a manual UP and DOWN button. The lowest possible setting with the provided casters is a typical sitting desk or dining table height. So, depending on how you prefer to elevate your hands/arms for typing and using your mouse, you might consider an undermount keyboard/mouse thingy. It feels like the desk can be manually increased/decreased by 1/8"" increments -- you really should have no issue finding the right height for you.The frame has substantial enough weight to keep the top from feeling the slightest wobble. This was my biggest issue with my prior desk -- if I bumped it during a video call, it would wobble and look like I was having an earthquake.And the top is substantial enough to mount reasonably weighted items underneath. Not just baskets and tracks to hold cords and surge protectors, but PC mounts if, again, it's reasonable. Make sure your screw length won't penetrate the top surface. For what you set on top the desktop surface, follow the manufacturer's limits for combined weight.The frame box includes two of these cord holders. When mounted, they're out of sight - out of mind, so.. I don't have a use for them, yet! But I suppose they could hold headphones or a corded earbud/IEM. Maybe a few cords, dunno.I got the 32""Wx63""L unit. In hindsight, I might have gotten the longer desk (73"" I think) because my old desk was sort of L-shaped, but I'm using less equipment now that I have a KVM switch for my 2-PC / 2-monitor set-up. So I should be good to go.UNRELATED TO THE DESK ITSELF BUT CRITICAL TO KEEP IN MIND.. Just be very clear AND CAREFUL when setting up your cable management, accessories, and living beings stored/visiting under ANY sit-stand desk:- My PC is on a standalone cart just inches from the floor, under my desk to mitigate sound/vibration issues. I had to ensure my HDMI, DisplayPort and USB-3.0 cables (A) were long enough at the DESK'S MAX HEIGHT position AND MONITOR PLACEMENT and (B) didn't cause a trip hazard since there's a walking path along the backside of my desk. Be mindful of the absolute max-height needed where all your connections occur. The last thing you want is to proudly sit at your new desk, press the button for max height, hark! the herald desk rises to glory, annnnnnd your monitors (assuming on stands and not mounted on arms) get ever so slightly tilted then violently pulled back only to plummet to their demise.- I have two large speakers and my PC tower/cart under my desk. I had to make sure at the lowest possible position, the motor would not crush/break or otherwise come in contact with the top of those items. Luckily, the speakers are ~3"" away from the bottom of the motor, and the PC is set on the outside, between one of the legs and the wall. If you keep a filing cabinet or some other accessory under the desk, be aware of all elements under the desk's structural components during set-up.- Goes without saying.. Watch for small children and pets when raising and lowering the desk. When the desk achieves the lowest point, there are likely pinch points at the base of each leg.","Reviewed in the United States January 16, 2024",AEKWUQ2UQ6MDM6FES73JZNPQ7CJA,True,From the United States,"Size: 63 x 32-inch, Color: Carbon Fiber Top / Black Frame",B07V6ZSHF4,84.0

For most of the small hardware like screws, there was at least one extra leftover.The assembly was pretty straightforward and easy to follow. It took me about an hour to assemble by myself. After you attach the legs to the table top, you do have to flip it which would be easier with two people but it's not terribly heavy so it's doable by yourself.For the space I have available, the 55"" fits perfectly and has room for both of my laptops and an extra monitor.

The three presets allow you to set a sitting height, standing height and another height that I use for when I'm on the standing board which bumps me up another inch or two.

R1MNDL36NV7UIA,Very solid; use outlet instead of power strip,Amazon Customer,4,"The desk was pretty easy to build. Some of the instructions differ between the video and the paper booklet, but these differences didn't seem to be important to the final build. My desk did ship with one of the connections for the motor snapped off, but it still seems pretty stable and functional with only the one side connected.For anyone who uses a power strip instead of an outlet: make sure the strip is elevated so that you can raise and lower the desk without putting tension on the cord. The cord provided (at least for the 40"" desk) was pretty short, and when plugged into the power strip on the ground, the tension on the cord loosened the connectors to the motor so that the raise and lower wasn't working. I fixed the issue by setting the power strip on top of something, but later decided just to plug the desk into the outlet. There weren't issues when using the outlet instead of the power strip, so this is what I would recommend.The raising and lowering feels very stable, and the build seems solid. I was initially worried about finding a shelf to put all my desk decorations on, but I think I can trust them to be raised and lowered without falling. The memory keys are a fantastic feature and are easy to use.

Some of the instructions differ between the video and the paper booklet, but these differences didn't seem to be important to the final build. My desk did ship with one of the connections for the motor snapped off, but it still seems pretty stable and functional with only the one side connected.For anyone who uses a power strip instead of an outlet: make sure the strip is elevated so that you can raise and lower the desk without putting tension on the cord. The cord provided (at least for the 40"" desk) was pretty short, and when plugged into the power strip on the ground, the tension on the cord loosened the connectors to the motor so that the raise and lower wasn't working. I fixed the issue by setting the power strip on top of something, but later decided just to plug the desk into the outlet.

R2FXISCGRAHMCU,Great new work desk,James B,5,"I have been wanting to try a standing desk but all the ones I seen were super expensive and I was concerned about spending too much on one to just not use it. I bought this on prime day and it also had a coupon so I got it for a good reasonable price where if I ended up not liking the standing part of it I didn't spend a lot of money to try it out. It's worth the full price in my opinion.Putting it together was really easy. You do need an wrench (adjustable or a set with the size needed) to put it together. It comes with an Allen wrench and a small screw driver but I ended up using a normal sized one I have at home. The motor comes attached and hooked up, all you need to do is plug it into the control box once you get it installed. I think it took me maybe 30 minutes to complete the setup.Sturdiness is there. I don't feel like it is wobbly at all and I adjust the desk up and down at least once during the day as I am not used to standing all day just yet and need to switch. I have 2 monitors, a laptop, keyboard, mouse and a docking station all on it and nothing shifts moving it up or down.Desktop is like any modern desk top that is on the cheaper end and made out of pressed wood. I personally don't have a problem with it and at this price point you can't expect it to be top quality oak anyway. It's a sturdy top and have not had any issues out of it. It holds everything I need it to hold with no issues and works perfectly.The controls are easy to use and has two memory settings that can easily be changed.Overall I recommend this to anyone wanting to try a standing desk.","Reviewed in the United States October 25, 2023",AG4X24EOBBOPKR2QWV4LNLZXRGXA,True,From the United States,"Size: 48x24""WholePiece, Color: Black",B0CC8CB4WL,18.0
R1R55BVHZA4S5D,Tremendous Value for the money - returned another desk for this one! Works okay for 6'6 height,Luke F,5,"I purchased an expensive Vivo desk originally while my partner purchased this one. Once we had built both I opted to return the other desk and also buy a mount up! I really like the following about this desk:- Assembly was super easy. Unlike other desks this is one piece construction for the frame- Large transformer is mounted under your desk out of the way and the cables were long enough to stretch to outlets on either side of the desk (seems simple.. but shockingly my other desk was going to require me to get an extension cord and I had to deal with the big transformer near the outlet/on the floor!)- height works well for tall individuals especially if you install wheels. I am 6'7 and this desk is probably just a tiiiiny bit short for me fully standingAreas for improvement:- the table top is solid wood and totally fine, although the whole desk would feel sturdier if it was a little thicker. Considering the price not sure you can reasonably expect more in this range- perhaps tied to the table top thickness, but the desk can shake a little at max height + wheels. Again considering the value here I don't think you'll get much better performance anywhere in this price range","Reviewed in the United States June 11, 2024",AEPV3Q4BC3OWALN2NROLBBVK2WYA,True,From the United States,"Size: 48x24""WholePiece, Color: White",B0CC8CB4WL,6.0

R2J2KWAQNS0DKD,Reasonable quality for a desk at this price point,merlin113,4,"The desk itself is pretty good quality for this price. The desk feels pretty solid and the materials, while not heavy, seem sufficient for the purpose. Assembly is easy and took less than 30 minutes. However, the control unit on my desk was dead out of the box and I can't get a response from MOUNTUP customer service to get a resolution. Considering a return as I would like the ability to raise and lower the desk. So marking this as three stars for a pretty good product, but not so good customer service.UPDATEI would like to update my previous feedback to say that MOUNTUP did eventually reach out me. They did send a replacement power supply and control unit for the desk, which took a week to arrive. It took both parts, but the issue has been resolved and the desk now works as designed. In the end, MOUNTUP customer service did make things right. I'm upgrading my rating as the desk is a good value for the money.","Reviewed in the United States February 1, 2025",AG43VCH4TNCX3QNPV6EENREREJJA,True,From the United States,"Size: 48x24""WholePiece, Color: Black",B0CC8CB4WL,1.0
R209B7FRCFQTEH,Terrific sit/stand desk,Amazon Customer,5,"Desk arrived very quickly, and was packaged extremely well. I like that this desk is one solid top piece, versus the multitude of options that are two piece tops, which are not as secure or durable. The legs are fully metal, and the feet can be adjusted to prevent wobbling. The assembly was a breeze, instructions are very well written and hardware is clearly and easily laid out, probably took me no more than 45min to an hour by myself. The motor and mechanism work great so far, and the controls are excellent. I absolutely love how they include cable management pieces that stick on the underside. I have yet to use them but surely will when I configure the setup permanently.Perhaps the only complaint is the plastic grommets that fit in the top holes of the desk that allow you to run cables through. The actual round outer piece is very difficult to get in, you really have to press hard, and in doing so, the inner piece pops out (one of mine actually broke) and it’s basically impossible to get it back in once the outer piece is set. It’s really a minor complaint, because you can just use the outer piece by itself or even just the holes themselves without the grommet. I myself have a monitor stand you can see in the pictures, so it covers it all anyways.All in all I am very pleased with this product so far, especially for the price. Will provide updates if anything changes.

Works okay for 6'6 height,Luke F,5,"I purchased an expensive Vivo desk originally while my partner purchased this one. Once we had built both I opted to return the other desk and also buy a mount up!

I am 6'7 and this desk is probably just a tiiiiny bit short for me fully standingAreas for improvement:- the table top is solid wood and totally fine, although the whole desk would feel sturdier if it was a little thicker.

R209B7FRCFQTEH,Terrific sit/stand desk,Amazon Customer,5,"Desk arrived very quickly, and was packaged extremely well. I like that this desk is one solid top piece, versus the multitude of options that are two piece tops, which are not as secure or durable. The legs are fully metal, and the feet can be adjusted to prevent wobbling. The assembly was a breeze, instructions are very well written and hardware is clearly and easily laid out, probably took me no more than 45min to an hour by myself. The motor and mechanism work great so far, and the controls are excellent. I absolutely love how they include cable management pieces that stick on the underside. I have yet to use them but surely will when I configure the setup permanently.Perhaps the only complaint is the plastic grommets that fit in the top holes of the desk that allow you to run cables through. The actual round outer piece is very difficult to get in, you really have to press hard, and in doing so, the inner piece pops out (one of mine actually broke) and it’s basically impossible to get it back in once the outer piece is set. It’s really a minor complaint, because you can just use the outer piece by itself or even just the holes themselves without the grommet. I myself have a monitor stand you can see in the pictures, so it covers it all anyways.All in all I am very pleased with this product so far, especially for the price.

R209B7FRCFQTEH,Terrific sit/stand desk,Amazon Customer,5,"Desk arrived very quickly, and was packaged extremely well. I like that this desk is one solid top piece, versus the multitude of options that are two piece tops, which are not as secure or durable. The legs are fully metal, and the feet can be adjusted to prevent wobbling. The assembly was a breeze, instructions are very well written and hardware is clearly and easily laid out, probably took me no more than 45min to an hour by myself. The motor and mechanism work great so far, and the controls are excellent. I absolutely love how they include cable management pieces that stick on the underside. I have yet to use them but surely will when I configure the setup permanently.Perhaps the only complaint is the plastic grommets that fit in the top holes of the desk that allow you to run cables through. The actual round outer piece is very difficult to get in, you really have to press hard, and in doing so, the inner piece pops out (one of mine actually broke) and it’s basically impossible to get it back in once the outer piece is set. It’s really a minor complaint, because you can just use the outer piece by itself or even just the holes themselves without the grommet. I myself have a monitor stand you can see in the pictures, so it covers it all anyways.All in all I am very pleased with this product so far, especially for the price.

Sometimes you get cheap, Chinese, crap that won't last a year, and other times you're pleasantly surprised by the quality.The packaging was impressive, even though it did have that terrible styrofoam that explodes all over your house. Each item was individually wrapped in its own protective box for added protection during shipping, and I didn't have any issues, scratches, dents or dings.The instructions weren't that great, but they were more than sufficient enough for an easy installation. Only took me about 15 minutes to put together, and everything felt like it was made from quality materials that you would find at a decent furniture store.The desk looks great and was easy to install, but my favorite part was all the added cable management supplies that they included. I was too lazy to check if all the extra cable management supplies provided were mentioned in the listing before writing this review, but I didn't know when I bought the desk and it was an awesome surprise and an added bonus. They even included padding strips to protect your desk and walls.This desk is every bit worth the regular price, and if you can get it for the $99 or less that I got it for, snatch it up quick!

R1YA2U1G3N5CYA,Good value. Particle board desktop.,Victor Bye,4,"Reasonably sturdy for the price. It took just over an hour to assemble. The legs and base are steel and quite sturdy. The desktop surface comes in two pieces and is a bit thin and made of particle fiber-board. My biggest concern is the potential for screws to strip out of the soft particle board. There are 8 screws that mount the desktop to the base, and that could pull loose if you try to move the desk once assembled. So if needed, move it by grasping the base. The lift motor seemed to work well, no issues. Overall, it serves our purpose as an added work-from-home desk space. We paid $90 after a $10 coupon. At that price, this is a good value.

The desk was fairly easy to put together. I can't say that the craftmanship is the highest...there is slight raise between two boards on the desk, but I have a desk pad so it is not noticeable. I really like the memory settings...I just push a button, go grab a cup of coffee and I'm set to go. The cable management is decent and works well with the 'management tray' that I picked up since don't like having power strips on the floor with pets. You know what I'm talking about if you have ever had a cat shut down your computer in the middle of work.The only thing I didn't care much more and didn't install was the hooks on the side for a bag or heads...they are just awkward to get too, though I'm sure you could build muscle memory.

R2QF9U3UPDN81I,Budget desk - Absolutely worth it.,Vincent M.,5,"The media could not be loaded. Honest review - trust me.Save time and just use a drill for the screws. Don't go crazy, but it'll ensure it's secure. Screwdriver won't get the job done (at least it didn't for me). Also - definitely a two man project. If you don't have a buddy it's not impossible - just harder than it has to be.The desk stayed upside down for days (almost a week) cause I needed a drill and a +1. So plan accordingly.Other than that - its a quality buy. Height adjustment is actually great. Lowest setting is perfect for sitting in any standard char - highest setting reaches right between my chest / stomach and I'm 5'9. It's only been a few days, so I can't speak to the lifetime of the motor but it's relatively quite (might want to adjust before your meeting if you WFM).I got the 55' desk. Dividing it in 1/3's I have an xbox to one 1/3, a 27' monitor in the middle and my macbook air to the other side. With better planning I could easily hold two screens across the width (wall mounted / arm mounted) and use a shelf etc to maximize space. If you're nervous about a buy like this as I was, this seems to be quality enough for the item price.","Reviewed in the United States April 13, 2025",AEE3A2AUTUSVZZXSBVQEX7YOTMHA,True,From the United States,"Size: 55 inches, Color: Rustic Brown",B0DR25DH7V,

R3LKMF8BBMVAP2,"Desk is great, packaging could be better",Justin M.,4,"This desk is fine for what I need. It holds a dual-monitor setup with a mini-pc and a few peripherals, and the movement up and down is smooth and seems great. The desk top is cheap particle board with a thin laminate finish, in two long skinny slabs, one in front, one in back. It's also pretty thin. If you intend to screw a keyboard tray or a cord management basket into it, your screws will need to be pretty short. If you were rough at all with this desk it'd probably fall apart, but be gentle and don't overload it and it should be fine.The packaging the desk arrived in could have been better. There were plastic corner guards taped on the outside of the box that were almost all ripped off and gone when we got it. The interior of the box also didn't have much padding. One corner was a little mashed, and it was enough to damage the desk slabs, as shown in the photos. It wasn't enough damage for me to want to send it back, but it's a bit disappointing.Other than the damage, everything has been fine. Assembly was fine, no mis-aligned holes as others have reported. No need to modify anything. It's a little wobbly when at standing height, as you might expect from a cheap standing desk, but it's really not bad. We've been using it for almost two months and it's been great.","Reviewed in the United States September 8, 2024",AHNK64HEMNJLTRR3FL4ZKI34XFUQ,True,From the United States,"Size: 55 inch with drawer, Color: Rustic Brown",B0DR25DH7V,4.0
R1CEUCB8BN0M2Z,As advertised 😊👍,Karen Hersh,5,"Very easy to put together, desk top is level and even (one side doesn’t stick up a little farther than the other side). The motor movement is smooth and fairly quiet. Haven’t had time to read the book yet, not sure what the 1 and 2 are for on the control panel? 🤷‍♀️ Tried it today for the first time, while standing at the desk at its full height. I’m 5’10”, and the desk was at the perfect height for me to stand and type with the keyboard on the top of the desk. The desk felt a bit wobbly when it was extended as far as it could go, but not too horrible. My niece helped put it together, and she liked it so much she was thinking about getting the same model for herself. 😊👍","Reviewed in the United States March 17, 2025",AGUZ4CQGO3Y3OPC2HBAEFHPXE32Q,True,From the United States,,B0DR25DH7V,

I havent experienced a flexing desk some others who left reviews. But the desk kniks and scratches easy. Installation is easy but screws maybe misaligned. The motor is the absolute worst thing about this desk. Day one for me it has never work and continues to not work. If your goal is to get a cheap desk, by all means get this desk.

R1K29AL9EPMSA1,"Works great, smooth walk, only goes to 2.5 though",Lily Jones,4,"I love the treadmill and no assembly required. There are two things I am not fond of: one is that it is shorter than I am used to, so I have to be careful not to walk off the back of the treadmill. I bought a wheel-free walker just to have something to hold onto while on the treadmill to stay standing straight and avoid moving too much, which was a solution for me. The other thing I don't like is that the speed only goes up to 2.5, which I should have checked before purchasing, but the speed I normally use is 2.6 or 2.7 for walking, so it's not a big issue. Overall, the treadmill works very smoothly, is very sturdy and well built, and I am still glad I purchased it even with the two cons.","Reviewed in the United States April 4, 2025",AGP32TY7AH335JKRMX42W3M4NV7A,True,From the United States,Style: 05-Mini-Black-80cm,B0DD3VT6D2,

Apparently, the belt has a mind of its own—sliding left, right, then left again—like it’s auditioning for a terrible Broadway dance number.Adjusting the belt? Sure! Just grab an Allen wrench, twist some knobs, whisper a prayer, and you might as well do the Hokey Pokey because that’s about as successful as you’ll get at straightening this contraption out. I spent more time fiddling with it than actually walking, and by the end, my heart rate was up only from frustration, not exercise.

I've walked on it for 3 sessions of 30-45 minutes between 2 and 3.5 mph with almost no issues (230lb 5'10""). It had no problem keeping up the pace, and generally the belt did not slip (see below for the exception). It is easy to move, and it connects with the app easily. The remote works.Walking experience: The walking surface is less shock-absorbent than a ""real"" treadmill, but still passable. Know that even the larger ""plus"" model is much smaller than your average treadmill. If you are tall like me, it takes some practice to be able to walk without scraping the front of the cover while also not letting your feet off the end. For me, it's exactly big enough to walk normally with zero extra space. I would have liked an extra inch or two on the sides and in the length so that I didn't have to train myself to stay in the exact ideal spot.On belt slipping: The belt assembly comes mostly balanced -- I noticed some minor drift at first, but nothing major. But I have a, perhaps unwise, habit of stepping off of treadmills at low speed or during their cooldown phase by letting the belt pull me off the end and landing on one foot. I did it on this one, and the belt became horribly unbalanced, slid all the way to one side, and ground a small divot into the plastic of the side rail before I could get it to stop. It took about 20 minutes of careful adjustment with the included allen key to get it to run normally again. This is likely user error, but be aware that the belt assembly is more delicate than your average, more durable treadmill, as I've never had this issue on ""real"" treadmills. I would recommend always using its ramp-up and ramp-down functions instead of jumping on or off at speed to avoid this. There are good tutorials online for tightening and balancing a treadmill belt.Safety concern: The manual mentions a magnetic safety key, but my model does not seem to have one, and runs normally without any kind of key. As I don't plan on going higher than 3.5mph, and as it is very close to the ground, this does not concern me a ton, but it is something to consider.

Good value for the money I spent.I do wish the remote control had a pause button but maybe I missed that somewhere.

After day 3, I realized the machine was getting so hot and creating too much thermal energy that it is burning the bottom of my shoes!!! At first I thought maybe it was due to old shoes so I bought new walking/running shoes and it is burning the soles of my new $100 tennis shoes! That is what the mysterious “dust” is! I am so livid!

RB9LJLQUEJF7X,So far so good,Joni Holt,5,"I just got this today so I will edit after we’ve used for a couple of weeks to a month. So far we are extremely happy with this. It is very quiet. The remote works perfectly. We absolutely love that there is no construction, comes completely ready to be used. It comes with an extra battery for the remote with one installed as well. It comes with 2 bottles of lubricant but is already lubricated and ready to go. The remote is super easy to use and there are instructions but you truly don’t need them. The 3.8 mph is excellent. It almost has you at a slow jog. My husband and I are both senior citizens so I did purchase a bar to hold onto for safety purposes. When you are done make sure the rollers are completely stopped before getting off as there are no sides to step off on. The really cool thing is that you get a countdown as to how long to its going before it’s stopped, so far for us no it’s less than 6 seconds. You do have to use the on off switch if you want to completely turn the unit off. Use a platform or hardwood to place it on. It doesn’t feel right on carpet. The display is large enough for our old eyes to see with no spectacles. The unit is easy to roll and tuck away under table or bed. For our couch it doesn’t fit but it may fit yours depending on how much clearance you have on yours. The rollers are pretty small but the unit is lightweight and my husband and I can easily move it around. We did check it out completely and found no dents or dings. Pay attention to the Vine reviews as they test the product so typically give honest and detailed reviews. The price is so reasonable and we feel we get as good a workout as we do using a traditional treadmill without the bulk of course.

R15PPKHJIN2ZGU,Walking pad,CC,4,"The media could not be loaded. I’m pretty happy with this walking pad. Since starting a sedentary job and starting to have kids, I’ve gained a lot of weight and I just don’t have the energy to do anything. I work from home 3 days a week and bought a standing desk to help reduce my sedentary job, but it didn’t seem to do much. I got this walking pad and have been using it for a few months and while I haven’t lost much weight, I feel better and I can tell it’s made a difference. I’m able to walk about 5 miles during the day while I’m working. This is a huge increase from the zero I was doing before.On to the specific pad. This pad seems to be quieter than the few I’ve seen. I’m about 225 pounds and a couple others I tried out were pretty loud every time you stepped on it. The plastic pieces would creak and kind of grind and this one doesn’t do that. The motor itself is fairly quiet, but on par with others I tried. Its not quiet enough to do while on the phone h less you had a really effective noise canceling headset.The instructions are pretty clear and it comes with a bottle of oil to lubricate it. It also tells you how to adjust the pad if it slides off at all. My floor is actually slightly slanted (120 yr old house) and the belt does get slightly off because of this. It’s super easy to fix.I’ve seen some of these where they fold or roll out of the way easily and this doesn’t do that, but I never expected it to.It has both count down and count up features, which is. Ice. The remote it comes with works perfectly and I haven’t had any problems with it. The pad only goes to 3.8 which I’m guessing was determined to be the fastest speed while still being safe. I wish if went a hair faster, but I’d rarely use it that fast, so it’s not a big deal.It fits perfectly under my desk and I’m thrilled to be able to use it while I work.","Reviewed in the United States March 22, 2025",AFTIJKX6PMHWBJHE2YJEMMGITQYA,False,From the United States,,B0DPLTD9VL,10.0

R20GKVSTWIHYU0,Awesome walking pad !!,cathye,5,"I bought this walking pad to extend cardiac rehab (slow and steady) at home after suffering a heart attack during winter. I researched several before buying this one. The quality is very good. It counts up before starting and counts down before stopping, it has a pause feature and also uses a remote. I like that it fits under my bed when not being used and I personally do not have trouble storing it although it may be harder for an elderly person. Overall, I’m really impressed with this item and would buy it again.","Reviewed in the United States March 1, 2025",AH67YMX54CHDBHJZEYYSAFK3SSUQ,True,From the United States,,B0DPLTD9VL,11.0
R2JM3H4KAJCMAE,Great for sit to stand desk! (in standing position of course!),James Richters,5,"I have been completely overwhelmed with a gigantic project for the last 3 years. It's an extremely complex project that requires me to be on my computer all day every day for long hours, 7 days a week. Needless to say, I've put on more pounds that I would have liked... it just doesn't help that the only walking I was doing was to walk to the refrigerator and back to my desk. I got a sit to stand desk so at least I could get out of the chair and stand for a while, and that did help a lot, but I still just found it nearly impossible to take the time out to go for a real walk... so I got this, specifically so I could walk while working on my project. I find that under my desk in standing position, it works pretty well, I would not recommend it just in the middle of a room without a desk, because you have nothing to hold onto for balance... this is really only meant to be under a standing desk because it has no handrails. It is easy to put in place and to roll away to a corner when I need to sit for a while. I use it as much as I can, but to be honest, it's difficult to work on certain aspects of my project while walking, it's not the device, it's just a matter of being able to operate my computer while walking... I cannot type hardly at all while walking, and for my CAD designs and solid models, they require precision mouse usage, and even though I have a professional trackball that is very precise, if I am walking, it's hard to make it track correctly. There are some tasks I can do while walking, like checking emails, searching for and purchasing supplies and materials on Amazon, or generating invoices for customers... stuff that doesn't take any extensive typing or precision mouse movements... so I do get some use out of it... and it actually keeps me on task a little better because if I set up this treadmill, then I want to get all those things done while it's set up, because I know once I go back to the more critical tasks, I won't be able to use it... so it prevents me from flip-flopping between tasks as I need to set it up and put it away.","Reviewed in the United States February 28, 2025",AHUE2ALXOQYZXOVHFG2ZRPH3K5SA,False,From the United States,,B0DPLTD9VL,

The remote works perfectly. We absolutely love that there is no construction, comes completely ready to be used. It comes with an extra battery for the remote with one installed as well. It comes with 2 bottles of lubricant but is already lubricated and ready to go. The remote is super easy to use and there are instructions but you truly don’t need them. The 3.8 mph is excellent.

When you are done make sure the rollers are completely stopped before getting off as there are no sides to step off on. The really cool thing is that you get a countdown as to how long to its going before it’s stopped, so far for us no it’s less than 6 seconds. You do have to use the on off switch if you want to completely turn the unit off. Use a platform or hardwood to place it on. It doesn’t feel right on carpet. The display is large enough for our old eyes to see with no spectacles. The unit is easy to roll and tuck away under table or bed. For our couch it doesn’t fit but it may fit yours depending on how much clearance you have on yours. The rollers are pretty small but the unit is lightweight and my husband and I can easily move it around. We did check it out completely and found no dents or dings.

Seen the TheNeat walking pad and had to buy. Received it in one day no assembly just have to plug in. Comes with a remote control with battery already in it, also comes with an extra battery when it dies. Also remote has a wrist bracelet and is light weight to have the controller comfortably on hand when you are on the treadmill. The remote has controls to go slow to fast, pause and stop, and with a mode control button. It’s a nice black not an eye sore. Perfect size to fit in any room and while walking it doesn’t make you feel like you’re going to fall off. Has a 2.5 powerful motor that works so smoothly and can barely hear when it’s on, not a distraction if at work, and can’t hear a thing with headphones on. The speed range is from .6 to 3.8 works nice for if I’m exhausted or want to go for a nice jog. And after I’m done I can store it in multiple locations in my house do to sizing not being to big. Appreciate how they send you the 2 lubricants so when it wears down a little you don’t have to buy and keep it running for a while with no worries. Glad I came across this product, got it at a good price for the quality of the item. This past week I been consistently using it before work and when I get off.

The walking pad has just the info I want; not a bunch of data and features that I don’t want. There are no handles, so using under a standup desk is safest, but I use a hiking stick for balance (I’m 62 😉) so that helps me to not fall. The remote control is awesome!

R1MF0XONF3A6L6,My best purchase of the last 3 years!,CleaningCrazedMom,5,"Purchased this with Non-Electric Auto-Lifting Standing Desk, No Knobs or Crank, Cordless, Rolling and Mobile, Great for Walking Pad, Adjustable Height 28.1'' to 43.3'', Desktop Size 31.5'' by 15.7'', Color BlackI was disappointed that it didn't incline, wasn't a tad longer, and only goes up to 3.8mph (another brand I looked at went up to almost 8mph), but I was not willing to use it for running/jogging anyways, so it turns out that I use it between 2.8 and 3.0 anyway. And this unit was considerably cheaper. It was also the flattest version I compared, thinking I might store it under my couch/bed at some point.Takeaway: It is awesome! I'm getting in about 6 extra miles of exercise daily and feel great! For some reason, I must have an odd gait, because we had to adjust it the first week about 6 times to keep the belt from shifting left. I even checked with a level to make sure it was even (and not slanted on my floor). But it was fine. I am reticent to let my teens and husband use it because they appear to all have more normal gaits (it only shifts right if they use it and then I use it after them.) But it is more of a tool that I use with self-control and planning, but I imagine that they will lose interest in it as a fun new toy in the house, and we only had to adjust it once after the first week. We are all tall (I'm the short one), so we accidentally broke off the two plastic protectors at the back of the unit in the first 24 hours with our long strides. We just taped them back on with black duct tape. Just make sure you don't tape the back side in case you need to use the hex key (Allen wrench) to adjust your belt.","Reviewed in the United States March 9, 2025",AGV7ALSFSAACGMOCMGERYLRMZHAQ,True,From the United States,,B0D7W1XWWV,2.0

He opened the panel and messed with it a bit to try to make the beeping function stop, but it didn’t work.

My complaint is I wish it were about 6 inches wider and 6 inches longer. I’m 6’3” with size 14 feet and a 32” inseam. I have a tendency to step off to the side if I don’t pay close attention to stay locked in at the front edge. For that reason, I can’t really watch tv. I’m also too heavy at 310lbs to use the incline. It’ll incline, but the surface slips as if the motors aren’t strong enough. I didn’t buy it for the incline, so no loss there!I’d like to see a digital readout like the timer for the speed, but the speed gauge is fine. I feel I can’t safely use it beyond 2.8mph because of the size, but others may be able to use it if they’re smaller than me.

The quiet motor is a plus, although the automatic speed adjustment can be somewhat tricky and a bit complex to set different exercise levels with the Remote control that comes with it. The treadmill’s portability and straightforward setup are significant advantages. Overall, I would give it a 4.5/5 rating, primarily due to its convenient functionality and space-efficient design.","Reviewed in the United States March 25, 2025",AHC6YEU3SU22EX25L2SLUGKMBYUQ,True,From the United States,Color: Black,B0D6BFMNN5,2.0

Somehow I turned off the beeps, that was a huge help. The beeps when you change settings are loud, but can be disabled (though I'm not sure what combination of buttons I pressed to do this).It is fairly quiet, it gets a bit louder as you increase speed, but its from the belt not the motor. The elevate function works well, you can easily change speeds and incline while walking on it.I've had a few instances of a single belt slip during a session, but nothing to complain about I'd expect this is normal for any device of this type.I have reached out to customer service via email to get information, they were polite and quick to respond, that makes me a bit more confident in the product.","Reviewed in the United States March 21, 2025",AEB7TPLKFY23BGDI62EDH3RIGO7A,True,From the United States,Color: Black,B0D6BFMNN5,9.0

Says 15,000 hours commercial grade including motor so we'll see. Love the screen and incline, for in the home theater watching hiking walking videos for treadmill while on this. Just go for hours walking Japan etc on YouTube... Only on for an hour straight so far. Don't forget to grease the belt, but not too much. It will slip when steep inclined and when walking pushes it easily. So don't use too much. Else maybe tighten it slightly more. Also I use a lot of power with the receiver projector subwoofers yes 2... So jo it does not need it's own dedicated outlet like I have read from others as well.

My complaint is I wish it were about 6 inches wider and 6 inches longer. I’m 6’3” with size 14 feet and a 32” inseam. I have a tendency to step off to the side if I don’t pay close attention to stay locked in at the front edge. For that reason, I can’t really watch tv. I’m also too heavy at 310lbs to use the incline. It’ll incline, but the surface slips as if the motors aren’t strong enough. I didn’t buy it for the incline, so no loss there!I’d like to see a digital readout like the timer for the speed, but the speed gauge is fine. I feel I can’t safely use it beyond 2.8mph because of the size, but others may be able to use it if they’re smaller than me.
