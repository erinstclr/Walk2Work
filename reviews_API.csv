R1466M9ZGQFIYV,Width Is A Problem,W. Horton,2,"The product arrived promptly and was easy to set up. It is easy to operate and seems to work very well. The reason for my less than positive review is that the treadmill is simply not wide enough. I find it hard to walk for very long on it because my natural stride has my feet slightly farther apart and I cannot do that on this item since it is not wider. Disappointingly, I would not have purchased if I had realized it was not wider. Otherwise, it appears to be a very good product.","Reviewed in the United States April 5, 2025",AGC2J5UESTTG6TRRX6KDVTFF6SQA,True,From the United States,Style: 05-Black-90cm,B0DD3VT6D2,
R1K29AL9EPMSA1,"Works great, smooth walk, only goes to 2.5 though",Lily Jones,4,"I love the treadmill and no assembly required. There are two things I am not fond of: one is that it is shorter than I am used to, so I have to be careful not to walk off the back of the treadmill. I bought a wheel-free walker just to have something to hold onto while on the treadmill to stay standing straight and avoid moving too much, which was a solution for me. The other thing I don't like is that the speed only goes up to 2.5, which I should have checked before purchasing, but the speed I normally use is 2.6 or 2.7 for walking, so it's not a big issue. Overall, the treadmill works very smoothly, is very sturdy and well built, and I am still glad I purchased it even with the two cons.","Reviewed in the United States April 4, 2025",AGP32TY7AH335JKRMX42W3M4NV7A,True,From the United States,Style: 05-Mini-Black-80cm,B0DD3VT6D2,

R18FWXM5MZ1LLI,"Bro, don't buy this",Hannah,1,"DO NOT BUY. Where do I even begin? Within 5 minutes on this “walking” pad, it started throwing me off like a mechanical bull at a county fair. It went from “gentle stroll in the park” to “tell my family I love them” in record time. Apparently, the belt has a mind of its own—sliding left, right, then left again—like it’s auditioning for a terrible Broadway dance number.Adjusting the belt? Sure! Just grab an Allen wrench, twist some knobs, whisper a prayer, and you might as well do the Hokey Pokey because that’s about as successful as you’ll get at straightening this contraption out. I spent more time fiddling with it than actually walking, and by the end, my heart rate was up only from frustration, not exercise. In the end, if you’d like to add some excitement to your home—perhaps by yelling at an inanimate object every morning—go for it.

To be continued... update, extending my apologies to the company and anyone that my negative comments lead a stray.After I contacted the seller and informed them of what I thought was a defective product, the seller reached out to me and shipped a new walking pad immediately to correct the situation. After troubleshooting by taking the walking pad to a different house, it worked perfectly, no issues.The problem appears to be with house hold electrical system.

R10Q46DMA5JHEI,Not what I ordered-- but fine!,JohnInHoustonTexas,4,"I am very pleased with the GRAY SupeRun walking pad that was sent to me, even though I ordered a BLACK Deer Run. (Seems to be the same thing with the same specs.)Not sure how I ended up with a different color from a different brand.It was easy to put together, and was well packaged. Not a scratch or dent on the machine from shipping.I'm deducting a star for the impossibly difficult sticker at the top of the walking pad. Most of the time for items like this the adhesive will lift off with ease. This decal was the opposite. It left a trail of thick goo all over the top of the machine and it took about 45 minutes of scrubbing with Spray and Wash and 91% rubbing alcohol to get all of adhesive removed .🙄I do a lot of walking so if this treadmill does not hold up I will update my review.","Reviewed in the United States December 16, 2024",AE5XVWBVXWQU3RDVXXHBFUP3IOWQ,True,From the United States,Style: 06-Black-90cm,B0DD3VT6D2,1.0
R1GCLMGO6BC2SC,"Works well so far. Smallish for a tall person, belt is finnicky but fixable",Rachel,3,"Pros: works right out of the box. I've walked on it for 3 sessions of 30-45 minutes between 2 and 3.5 mph with almost no issues (230lb 5'10""). It had no problem keeping up the pace, and generally the belt did not slip (see below for the exception). It is easy to move, and it connects with the app easily. The remote works.Walking experience: The walking surface is less shock-absorbent than a ""real"" treadmill, but still passable. Know that even the larger ""plus"" model is much smaller than your average treadmill. If you are tall like me, it takes some practice to be able to walk without scraping the front of the cover while also not letting your feet off the end. For me, it's exactly big enough to walk normally with zero extra space. I would have liked an extra inch or two on the sides and in the length so that I didn't have to train myself to stay in the exact ideal spot.On belt slipping: The belt assembly comes mostly balanced -- I noticed some minor drift at first, but nothing major. But I have a, perhaps unwise, habit of stepping off of treadmills at low speed or during their cooldown phase by letting the belt pull me off the end and landing on one foot. I did it on this one, and the belt became horribly unbalanced, slid all the way to one side, and ground a small divot into the plastic of the side rail before I could get it to stop. It took about 20 minutes of careful adjustment with the included allen key to get it to run normally again. This is likely user error, but be aware that the belt assembly is more delicate than your average, more durable treadmill, as I've never had this issue on ""real"" treadmills. I would recommend always using its ramp-up and ramp-down functions instead of jumping on or off at speed to avoid this. There are good tutorials online for tightening and balancing a treadmill belt.Safety concern: The manual mentions a magnetic safety key, but my model does not seem to have one, and runs normally without any kind of key. As I don't plan on going higher than 3.5mph, and as it is very close to the ground, this does not concern me a ton, but it is something to consider. There do not appear to be any other safety features, other than the physical guards and warning labels.App: I haven't used it aside from testing the direct treadmill control functions. It did connect easily to the treadmill via bluetooth/wifi, and the controls from your phone do seem to work, which is great to have in case I lose the remote. The little virtual running game does seem functional, though I'm not particularly interested in the social media or monetization aspect of it.","Reviewed in the United States December 16, 2024",AF4UY3BRMLWMMDTBHCGMCZXEQR3Q,True,From the United States,Style: 06-Black-90cm,B0DD3VT6D2,2.0

R15S506BZC03PA,Cute and does what I need!,Myra Hicks,5,"It’s perfect to have in the corner of the office. When turned on it beeps loud and the motor is just a soft hum, not loud at all. When you walk on it is when it’s a bit louder (just from the belt rubbing against the tread as you step) and could bother other people around if you work in a space with others. I keep mine in an empty space currently with the door closed and no one can hear me walking on it only the beeps when you turn it off. Easy to use too. You only need to plug it in, flip the on/off switch in the front. It comes with a remote that I think it’s really neat and an extra battery. It also comes with a bolt tightening tool and lubricant for the belt. It’s built sturdy and has wheels. I really like it and it’s not too big, it’s a decent size if you don’t have a wide walk.

I haven’t had to adjust the belt quite as often. Maybe I’ve lost a few pounds (not from the device) so it stopped sliding as much without the pressure.Edited again: Back to the belt sliding and this time, the tool to adjust it isn’t working. It doesn’t turn enough to adjust it. I’ll keep you updated.Edited review: I used this walking pad 4 times before the belt slipped. They send a tool to align it. It took some work around to get it right but the Universe delivered because now it’s where I need it to be. It’s still not as stable as I would like but it works well enough to get the job done. Good value for the money I spent.I do wish the remote control had a pause button but maybe I missed that somewhere. Because I have to stop it every time, it starts the count over, but maybe the app fixes that. I didn’t download it. I like that the remote has a handle to keep around the wrist. Easy to use.

It’s perfect for casual walking while working or watching TV.L E N G T HAt 5’2”, the length of the walking pad is just right for me, but my 6’2” friend said it feels a bit short for his stride. So, if you’re taller, this could be something to consider.Q U A L I T YThe walking pad feels sturdy overall, and I appreciate that it was ready to use right out of the box—no assembly required. However, sometimes it glitches if I press the start button too quickly, and I have to restart it.A C C E S S I B I L I T YMoving it around is a bit of a hassle. While it’s not overly difficult, I frequently switch between walking and sitting while working, and I wish there was an easier way to move it. Also, I don’t have a convenient place to hide it, so it stays out in the open when not in use.S A F E T YThere’s no emergency stop feature, and the sides of the pad are small, so if I need to take a quick break, I either have to jump off or turn it off completely, which can be inconvenient.S T A T SEDIT: to Pause this machine you have to HOLD the pause button and it keeps your stats![Another annoying thing is that the stats reset when you hit pause, so your time and distance disappear. It would be nice to pause it for a quick break and pick up where I left off. But it’s not a dealbreaker.]S O U N DIt’s loud when you turn it on, and the beeping every time you increase or decrease the speed is pretty annoying. I hate the startup sound, but it’s not horrible—just one of those things you put up with.T A K E A W A YBecause of the price, I tolerate the negatives. I honestly love how easy it is to get my steps in, especially living in Arizona, where it’s too hot to walk outside most of the year.Would I buy it again? Maybe.

R15PPKHJIN2ZGU,Walking pad,CC,4,"The media could not be loaded. I’m pretty happy with this walking pad. Since starting a sedentary job and starting to have kids, I’ve gained a lot of weight and I just don’t have the energy to do anything. I work from home 3 days a week and bought a standing desk to help reduce my sedentary job, but it didn’t seem to do much. I got this walking pad and have been using it for a few months and while I haven’t lost much weight, I feel better and I can tell it’s made a difference. I’m able to walk about 5 miles during the day while I’m working. This is a huge increase from the zero I was doing before.On to the specific pad. This pad seems to be quieter than the few I’ve seen. I’m about 225 pounds and a couple others I tried out were pretty loud every time you stepped on it. The plastic pieces would creak and kind of grind and this one doesn’t do that. The motor itself is fairly quiet, but on par with others I tried. Its not quiet enough to do while on the phone h less you had a really effective noise canceling headset.The instructions are pretty clear and it comes with a bottle of oil to lubricate it. It also tells you how to adjust the pad if it slides off at all. My floor is actually slightly slanted (120 yr old house) and the belt does get slightly off because of this. It’s super easy to fix.I’ve seen some of these where they fold or roll out of the way easily and this doesn’t do that, but I never expected it to.It has both count down and count up features, which is. Ice. The remote it comes with works perfectly and I haven’t had any problems with it. The pad only goes to 3.8 which I’m guessing was determined to be the fastest speed while still being safe. I wish if went a hair faster, but I’d rarely use it that fast, so it’s not a big deal.It fits perfectly under my desk and I’m thrilled to be able to use it while I work.","Reviewed in the United States March 22, 2025",AFTIJKX6PMHWBJHE2YJEMMGITQYA,False,From the United States,,B0DPLTD9VL,9.0

R2JM3H4KAJCMAE,Great for sit to stand desk! (in standing position of course!),James Richters,5,"I have been completely overwhelmed with a gigantic project for the last 3 years. It's an extremely complex project that requires me to be on my computer all day every day for long hours, 7 days a week. Needless to say, I've put on more pounds that I would have liked... it just doesn't help that the only walking I was doing was to walk to the refrigerator and back to my desk. I got a sit to stand desk so at least I could get out of the chair and stand for a while, and that did help a lot, but I still just found it nearly impossible to take the time out to go for a real walk... so I got this, specifically so I could walk while working on my project. I find that under my desk in standing position, it works pretty well, I would not recommend it just in the middle of a room without a desk, because you have nothing to hold onto for balance... this is really only meant to be under a standing desk because it has no handrails. It is easy to put in place and to roll away to a corner when I need to sit for a while. I use it as much as I can, but to be honest, it's difficult to work on certain aspects of my project while walking, it's not the device, it's just a matter of being able to operate my computer while walking... I cannot type hardly at all while walking, and for my CAD designs and solid models, they require precision mouse usage, and even though I have a professional trackball that is very precise, if I am walking, it's hard to make it track correctly. There are some tasks I can do while walking, like checking emails, searching for and purchasing supplies and materials on Amazon, or generating invoices for customers... stuff that doesn't take any extensive typing or precision mouse movements... so I do get some use out of it... and it actually keeps me on task a little better because if I set up this treadmill, then I want to get all those things done while it's set up, because I know once I go back to the more critical tasks, I won't be able to use it... so it prevents me from flip-flopping between tasks as I need to set it up and put it away.","Reviewed in the United States February 28, 2025",AHUE2ALXOQYZXOVHFG2ZRPH3K5SA,False,From the United States,,B0DPLTD9VL,

It is also easy to move around. I have been using it while I work from home at a standing desk for about an hour each day. I wasn’t sure if I could work and walk at the same time, so I was surprised to find it actually helps me stay focused during conference calls. I’ve even learned that I can type and walk! Love that this allows me to get in more steps during the day, although my watch doesn’t pick up on the steps. So, I track the time I spend “indoor walking” as exercise on my watch.","Reviewed in the United States February 3, 2025",AG3GUM74QPROEG5NWXP2RLRXF4JQ,True,From the United States,,B0DPLTD9VL,1.0
R1KE0MV31CLPZN,Exercise while you work,Voidvz,5,"This under-desk treadmill is pretty light and easy to move, especially with the wheels. The remote is simple to use, and the max speed of 3.8 mph is perfect for a brisk walk. Great for getting steps in while working!Update: I really love how easy it is to move out of the way!","Reviewed in the United States February 3, 2025",AGHK6YJI6N6D6PH2C6EWZRPYPPMQ,True,From the United States,,B0DPLTD9VL,1.0
RGJIG5N82T5DO,Perfect way to start your health journey!!,Margaret Martinez,5,"This treadmill is so compact, lightweight, sleek, and the price point seems too good to be true. Im here to tell you its not!! Also I was worried about it holding my weight. I weigh over 250lbs and it holds me just fine. So just in case you were wondering!!! It's so easy to take out and store away. I can easily slide it from under my bed because of how light weight it is and easily slide it right back under . It's so compact it just fits right under no problem. Very easy to use. 10 out of 10 I would recommend!!","Reviewed in the United States February 2, 2025",AHCDVUKGTJDFSELBIZU3Z7UWQ3AQ,True,From the United States,,B0DPLTD9VL,43.0
